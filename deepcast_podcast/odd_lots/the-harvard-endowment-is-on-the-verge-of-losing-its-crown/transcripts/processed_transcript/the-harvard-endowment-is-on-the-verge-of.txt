Joe Weisenthal: Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.
Tracy Alloway: And I'm Tracy Alloway.
Joe Weisenthal: Tracy, we talk about investing all the time on the show. We talk about private credit, we talk about hedge funds, we talk about the market itself. But you know, there are like a few of these gigantic institutional players out there. One of them is insurance that, like, just don't get a lot of attention.
Tracy Alloway: These huge pools of capital. Yeah, you're right.
Joe Weisenthal: So, you know, we've talked about, we want to talk about insurance more. Should probably talk about family offices more too. Like, that's this whole world that I don't think we've ever really explored, but just this massive and booming source of capital. Like what the deal is with those.
Tracy Alloway: Yeah, I remember right around the time that I left Hong Kong, that was such a big story, especially in Singapore, everyone opening family offices. But there's another category of massive pools of capital that we need to talk about.
Joe Weisenthal: Absolutely. And that one, of course, is endowments. They're huge and they have, you know, they're distinct. They're distinct from banks, they're distinct from insurance companies. They have their own funding needs and their own funding profiles and the schedules with which they need to withdraw and disperse their money. And if you're a hedge fund or if you're anyone else looking for money for your investment, at the end of the line, there's a good chance that, like, at some point you're going to be knocking on the door of a really big endowment.
Janet Lauren: Yeah.
Tracy Alloway: So I'm really interested in kind of how that became a thing because, of course, university endowments nowadays are known for making investments in things like private equity and hedge funds and stuff like that. And I'm curious how all of that began and then obviously how it's been working out.
Joe Weisenthal: So. You know what another cool thing, Tracy, is, at least when it comes to university endowments. I believe the endowment of my alma mater, University of Texas, is on the verge.
Tracy Alloway: I knew that was coming.
Joe Weisenthal: Yeah, yeah. Is on the verge of becoming the biggest university endowment in the country.
Tracy Alloway: Right. So for years, Harvard was the biggest. Right. But it looks like it might be superseded by Joe's college. Congratulations. Congratulations, Joe.
Joe Weisenthal: Thank you.
Tracy Alloway: Have you been donating? Is this all you.
Joe Weisenthal: Can I just say I've never donated. They have so much money already. They don't need my donation. I probably should. I don't want to talk about how I avoid the calls from my university. And I don't know, I feel a little bad about it.
Tracy Alloway: I think, in this case. Well, we'll get into why, but maybe it's okay not to donate. Well, we'll talk about that.
Joe Weisenthal: I don't really want to talk about. I don't really want to. You know, and even talking about how big UT is versus, I think there's actually like 22 universities or something served by the Texas endowment and other things. So I don't even know if it's a true apples to apples comparison because, you know, the student body of Texas is so gigantic. Nonetheless, if we're just looking at, okay, which university endowment is the biggest, at least current, there's a very good chance it looks like the Texas could eclipse Harvard on that front. So we got to understand what's going on more in endowment world. And then the other thing is not just that Texas has grown, and that's great, and I love to see it, but that Harvard's performance has been a little bit mediocre in recent years, even compared to just other Ivies, the rest of which sort of smaller. The Yale endowment is sort of famous, actually, not necessarily due to its size, but because of its longtime manager's approach to endowment investing. So we got to learn more about what's going on with Harvard and how these big institutional pools of capital, how they're performing and what they're doing.
Tracy Alloway: Yeah. It is kind of funny that the Harvard endowment, which presumably employs a lot of highly paid, smart people, I think it was up about 9.6% in 2024. That's the preliminary fiscal year. But of course, The S&P 500 is up like 22% so far. So.
Joe Weisenthal: Yeah, what's going on just by spy? No, like, people will say, oh, you can't really compare. People love to say. People love to say. You can't compare things. Oh, you can't compare hedge funds return to the S and P. You can't compare endowment funds return to S and P. Maybe that's true. I don't totally get why. Anyway, should we learn more?
Tracy Alloway: Let's do it.
Joe Weisenthal: Well, I'm really excited to say we do have the perfect guest. Someone here at Bloomberg who I've wanted to speak to on the podcast for a long time. We're going to be speaking with Janet Lauren, higher education finance reporter for Bloomberg. Janet, thank you so much for coming on odd lots.
Janet Lauren: Thanks for having me.
Joe Weisenthal: How do you get to be the higher ed finance reporter of Bloomberg? And also, it's like we just have one. What's the deal? These institutions are so important. We probably have, you know, 20 people covering hedge funds. We just have a higher education finance reporter.
Janet Lauren: Well, I've been writing about university finances for almost 17 years here at Bloomberg. And it's not just endowments, but I used to write a lot about student loans back when they were only about $1 trillion in outstanding debt and college admissions and endowments. And it's just a fun job and there's a lot of money involved and there's a lot of nuance that most people have no idea about. And I'm thrilled to talk about Harvard as well as University of Texas. It has an amazing story.
Joe Weisenthal: Great.
Tracy Alloway: Okay, so talk to us a little bit more about how significant the space is. Like, how much money are we actually talking about?
Janet Lauren: Off the top of my head, I mean, we're talking about several hundred billion dollars. The universe is, you know, there aren't too many college endowments that have over a billion. Maybe it's around 50. I can get you the exact number, but there certainly aren't that many the size of Harv and Yale and the University of Texas. And Harvard, I include in many stories is the oldest and richest university. It goes back to the 1600s. And Harvard was actually founded through a donation. And as donors, alumni, rich people in Boston gave them money over hundreds of years. You know about that thing called compounding interest?
Joe Weisenthal: Yeah. Imagine if you just bought spy in 1600. Sorry, Kubka.
Janet Lauren: So that has certainly helped them. But in the 1960s, college endowments started doing something different. Instead of having a traditional 60, 40 split, you know, with a lot of plain vanilla type US equities, bonds, they pursued a different model. And the Ford foundation actually presented this strategy in Schools like Harvard and Yale started using it because their time horizon is literally in the hundreds of years. So they liquidity for them is okay because, you know, they have a very long term horizon. So they started moving things into illiquid assets over time. Private equity, hedge funds, you know, eventually venture capital, real estate, you know, now private credit. But at the time that was a pretty new strategy. Harvard and Yale did things a little bit differently. So Harvard started, you know, Harvard Management Co. Which runs the endowment, is 50 years old this year. They actually operate not in Cambridge, but in downtown Boston in the Federal Reserve building. It's actually very close to our Bloomberg office in Boston. And they employed traders and it was over 200 people working there. They were extremely good at their job. Their strategy was literally the envy of the world. They made a ton of money. A guy by the name of Jack Meyer ran the fund. And there was some outcry by a group of alumni and people who thought their managers were being paid too much because they just consistently exceeded the market. And one year there was a manager, I'm trying to remember, who paid $35 million. And people were just aghast at that because they made too much money. So after a lot of criticism, long story short, that model was disbanded. Jack left in 2005. They went through a succession of managers. Seven CEOs of the Harvard Management Company. Some only stayed a short term. There were two, less than two years, several interims, changing strategies, selling off assets. You know, for a while they were big into agriculture and real assets. Those performed well, but then they didn't perform well. And the current CEO has been there since December 2016. He eventually sold a lot of those natural resources. You know, I think writing off like a billion dollars in, you know, change of strategy, not at the greatest time. They didn't have a lot of private equity and they've ramped that up.
Tracy Alloway: Now that was a great potted history of Harvard's endowment. I ought to say. Joe, I started rewatching. Did you ever watch the Gilmore Girls? Probably not.
Joe Weisenthal: No, I never did.
Tracy Alloway: I started rewatching Gilmore Girls and so.
Joe Weisenthal: Are you going to tie this in?
Tracy Alloway: Well, so it's all about rich people in Boston, basically. And one of the main characters has to decide between Harvard and Yale. She eventually goes to Yale. I guess she was lured by the performance of the endowment.
Joe Weisenthal: Janet, you gave us the broad history of Harvard's endowment. And I want to talk about actually what happened in those years from how you have one stable management company that goes all the way to 2005, more or less. And then you run through, I think, what did you say, seven CEOs since then or something. Then Tracy mentioned the Yale Endowment with their famous endowment manager for several years, David Swensen. Can you talk about the comparison and contrast between the strategic volatility and. I'm not even talking about price volatility, but the strategic management volatility of Harvard versus the Yale model that I think David wrote a whole book about.
Janet Lauren: So Harvard management company files a tax return, and because of their nonprofit status, they have to disclose how much they pay their top people. And Yale, the investment office, is part of Yale University. They employ outside managers and they have a much smaller number of employees and only a handful of listed in the tax return. And because they're using outside managers, you think of the 2 in 20 model that's not showing up in the tax return. Whereas Harvard, you could see how much they were getting paid. And people read that, and it was a big deal how much they were getting paid. And that's really a simple explanation of why Harvard's managers got so much more scrutiny.
Tracy Alloway: So you talked about the criticism of how much they're getting paid. What's the benchmark for Harvard's performance? What are they actually comparing themselves to?
Janet Lauren: Well, many endowments create their own benchmark.
Joe Weisenthal: Surprise.
Janet Lauren: So I don't know, they come up with it. And one of the big criticisms of Harvard's pay was the managers who did extremely well in their own asset class would get paid based on their own performance, not the overall performance of the endowment. So if they had a middling return, which they have, some of these managers still got paid quite a lot of money.
Joe Weisenthal: Well, then let me ask you another question. Let's say, okay, we don't really know what the benchmark is. So you wrote this piece for Bloomberg a few weeks ago talking about issues and the performance. What has it been? Why now are people saying, look, Harvard's performance is not that great. There's some reason to be concerned. There's some falling off in the what they're able to generate for the university.
Janet Lauren: Well, I think some insiders, especially some of their really famous economists, they know what's going on. But in the last year, the performance was overshadowed by some other issues, especially their president being thrown before Congress. The president resigned, she had a plagiarism scandal. People have been very upset about how Harvard has handled antisemitism. The story I had last week said their fundraising was down, their cash gifts was the lowest, fell 15%. It was the lowest since 2015. They famously raise a huge amount of money. They're known for the endowment, but they're also known for being prolific fundraisers. And they did get to a billion dollars last year. But I'm sure it wasn't easy considering people are upset. Len Blavatnik, Ken Griffin, both alums said they're not giving money. They've paused their gifts to Harvard because of the way things are going there.

Janet Lauren: The forces shaping markets and the economy are often hiding behind a blur of numbers.
Tracy Alloway: So that's why we created the Big Take from Bloomberg podcast to give you the context you need to make sense of it all.
Joe Weisenthal: Every day in just 15 minutes, we.
Janet Lauren: Dive into one global business story that matters.
Tracy Alloway: You'll hear from Bloomberg journalists like Matt Levine.
Janet Lauren: A lot of this meme stock stuff.
Joe Weisenthal: Is, I think, embarrassing to the SEC.
Janet Lauren: Follow the Big Take podcast on the iHeartRadio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you listen.
Tracy Alloway: So one thing I'm trying to wrap my head around is, as we've mentioned a number of times, Harvard is a huge pot of money. And I've heard people say stuff like because of its size, it makes it harder to move positions around. It can't be as nimble. But then I think, well, it's huge, so it should be getting like the best deals. It should have some sort of edge. So is size here a net pro or con?
Janet Lauren: I think that's a very fair question. And Harvard will say it's so big it's hard to manage $53 billion. Now keep in mind the size hasn't been that big ever. They had a huge $11 billion gain in fiscal 21 when everybody had a crazy year. Some endowments had gains at 50%. Harvard was on the low end at 34%. And of course they had a huge decrease during the financial crisis. So they've been building back, back up. Now the school with the best 10 year performance is Brown, and that has the smallest endowment size. And they're definitely more nimble, but they seem to take more risk. You know, they're into, you know, you've heard maybe there's some cryptocurrency or there, there's some other risk there. And if you go back and read all the Harvard alumni, I'm sorry, the Harvard financial reports, as I did, the current CEO talks a lot about risk. He mentions more than once that Harvard takes less risk than its large peers. And you know, it still could be a vestige from 2008 when they had a huge liquidity problem.
Joe Weisenthal: Let me ask another way of thinking about the benchmark. Setting aside, what is a good return in a given year or a good return over five years, what is the importance of the Harvard Endowment to the Harvard University budget? And because there's multiple ways of financing the university, there's tuition, there's alumni giving, there's probably other grants and stuff like that. And then there's the money that the endowment throws off. What does Harvard University need from the Harvard Endowment?
Janet Lauren: Well, the Harvard Endowment is the largest provider of money to the university. 37%.
Joe Weisenthal: Okay.
Janet Lauren: And that's grown over time. 10 years ago it was 31% and 20 years ago it was 20, 21%. So in other words, Harvard University is becoming a lot more reliant on the Harvard endowment.
Tracy Alloway: So you mentioned this idea of investing in alts, and I think Harvard was like a backer of D1, in particular a hedge fund. And I'm curious, the sales pitch from hedge funds is always uncorrelated returns. So what happened in down years for Harvard, like in 2022, 2023, when market were like. Or sorry, in 2023 when markets were falling, did they manage to post above average returns?
Janet Lauren: So over time in 2023, I think they had a 2.9% gain, which was not bad among the Ivy League schools. A couple of big endowments had losses. I think it was Duke and mit. And MIT is really strong in their returns too. We don't sort of use them in their eight schools because the Ivy League is a sports conference. But it' a nice group of eight schools that you can easily compare Harvard in the big year. In 21, they were below average in the Ivy League. Now, they didn't traditionally have the allocation to private equity and VCs that say Yale did. And Harvard is now at 39% in private equity. But they've ramped up really since 2016. I'm sorry, it was 16% maybe five years ago, six years ago, and now they're at 39%. They've been ramping up sort of not at the best time. And keep in mind that Yale has been investing in some of these private equity firms and VC for years and years and years. And people really want to be Yale's partner. And Harvard sort of has a reputation of not being the greatest partner because as you saw in the D1 example, they sell and they had to unload a billion dollars worth of natural resources assets. So people clamor to be in the Yale and the Princeton endowment because they're seen as just amazing partners. And Harvard doesn't seem to have that same reputation lately.
Joe Weisenthal: Yeah, I mean, I don't know that much about the Yale endowment model, but I probably should read David Swinson's book at some point and all that and really learn about it. But I do get the impression that it's designed to just be. Not set it and forget it. But truly it's all about that sort of all cycle portfolio that really can just. Is designed to ultimately work across a long cycle of whatever's in and out.
Janet Lauren: Well, they will look at firms for years before they may make an investment. So they tend to do their homework for a long time. And I think I remember in one report they said the average tenure of their outside managers is something like 13 years.
Joe Weisenthal: Wow.
Janet Lauren: So it's, you know, if you think getting into a school like Yale or Princeton is hard, try getting to be one of their managers.
Joe Weisenthal: Well, just actually. And I want to get into this more. But just a very quick question. Does Harvard have hedge fund allocation? Of course. Oh, yeah, yeah, you already talked about it. Okay, got it.
Janet Lauren: They do.
Joe Weisenthal: Okay.
Janet Lauren: And it's the second largest allocation now. It's at 32%. The largest allocation is private equity at 39%.
Joe Weisenthal: And just a very, very short question. If Tracy and I are starting a hedge fund and it's like a multi strategy hedge fund and all that stuff, would Harvard definitely be one of our stops when we're trying to look at raising money?
Janet Lauren: Did you go to Harvard? I'm just kidding. I don't know. It just depends. They like niche. Really niche stuff.
Joe Weisenthal: Got it.
Janet Lauren: So if you're, you know, peddling something like a Japanese, something fun that is really niche that nobody else is doing, maybe.
Tracy Alloway: So you mentioned the sort of turmoil at the upper levels of the Harvard endowment. And I think we're on the fifth CEO in like 11 years. Something like that. Can you describe the new CEO? Like, where does he come from? And is his style different to predecessors? I think he's done some restructuring of the company and things like that.
Janet Lauren: Yes. So he came in December 2016 from Colombia where he had excellent performance. And that was one of the reasons why he was hired because the performance at Columbia used to be pretty good. But he came in and had to steer a very large ship in a ship that's very scrutinized. Everybody wants to know how Harvard is doing. And as I mentioned before, they used to employ more than 200 people traders. They had a different model than Yale because they had a huge internal presence and they slashed that. He also reversed course on natural resources, where that had been a huge interest of Jane Mandillo, the previous longer term CEO of Harvard Management. But they didn't do as well. So he sold a lot of those off. They restructured pay. Again, we talked about if you're a manager and you did great in your own asset class, you would get handsomely rewarded. But if the endowment as a whole was not performing well, that didn't really matter. So he made a lot of changes.
Joe Weisenthal: Let's talk about. Actually, you mentioned natural resources, which could be code for a few things I seem to recall. I just remembered another thing that I remembered about David Swensen, which is I think he was like really into timber for a while and he was like sort of like famously into timber. But then there's another natural resource issue and this will eventually allow us to talk about what I really want to talk about, which is the University of Texas. But of course, resource politics and resource investing is always controversial when it comes to carbon fuels like oil and stuff like that. So before we get into Texas and all their oil money, what is the status of Harvard's own investments in things like oil, et cetera, and how does the sort of unique politics of Harvard affect those choices?
Janet Lauren: So for a long time, most schools were asked by their students to divest from anything related to fossil fuels. Harvard did not divest from anything. I think sometimes that's not understood. Well, divest means selling things. And Harvard said, we're not going to make new investment. So you know what it means to allow things to roll off. You're not going to make. When this next private equity fund is raising money, that means they may not go into it. They're not selling on the secondary market. Typically endowments don't have direct holdings. Or maybe they have a tiny amount. Maybe it was a gift and they still have held onto it. But typically endowments today do not have direct holdings in companies. That's how they used to in the 70s and 80s. And in the 80s, when you heard about schools divesting from investments related to apartheid, they were literally selling US companies that operated in South Africa. So that's a huge change. So they stopped making new fossil Fuel Investments and NARV wrote in one of the reports. In 22, when they had a loss, the CEO said Harvard had missed out on strong returns in the energy sector, and that decision contributed marginally to the loss that year. But at the same time, you look at a place like Texas, which has huge amounts of cash coming in because of oil, and is this a good time to bring up their history?
Joe Weisenthal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a good point.
Tracy Alloway: Where does the. How did the oil money kind of start?
Janet Lauren: So it was kind of a fluke in a lucky stroke of history. In the late 1870s, the state of Texas set aside land for higher education. And it was supposed to be near the railroad, but it was too valuable, and it got moved to West Texas. And eventually higher education in Texas was allotted something like 2.1 million acres in West Texas. And they were supposed to generate money by agriculture or grazing rights. And the plan was eventually to sell it. But then in 1923, something happened. Jo, do you know what happened?
Joe Weisenthal: Well, black gold was struck. No, there's a. At the University of Texas campus, there's this little. I don't know if it's still there.
Janet Lauren: But it is still there.
Joe Weisenthal: Yeah. 20 years ago, there's this little, like, sort of, I don't know, exhibit. And they play this audio. It's like spindle top black gold, and it has, like, with this really, like, exaggerated Texas accent. And there's like a fake oil Derek or oil well or something like that, and it sort of shows, like, where it all came from.
Janet Lauren: So in 1923, they literally started getting all this revenue from oil. And I did a story a couple of years ago. I went down to Midland and I went on the land. And that year they got something like $2 billion in cash. And it's completely separate from their endowment. It's not generated from investments. It's just cash that comes in. And the crazy thing about it is you hear, oh, well, at some point, energy is not going to be. Is not going to be as valuable, which it's still going to be around for 20, 30 years, generating a lot of money for Texas. But they're in the best position for wind and solar also, which is a really nascent industry there. But when you're ready for that, they're going to make a lot of money, too.
Tracy Alloway: It is kind of crazy to think that that decision to set aside land in the 1800s is really paying off now. So every once in a while, Joe will tweet something about the Texas Longhorns, the football team. And so one thing I'M curious about is we're talking about all this money that's flowing into universities. What's the breakdown of, like, where colleges get their money? So I imagine it's a mix of donations, returns from endowments. Are sports, like, part of that, too?
Janet Lauren: I don't think it's a huge amount. I mean, unless you're one of the schools, like Texas, that actually makes money on sports. But it's a very small number of schools actually collect somewhat of a. I don't want to say a profit, but generate revenue. But many schools have weird histories of how they made their money. Like Emory, for example, in Atlanta. They're one of the richest schools. And part of the reason is because of the Coke stock that was given to them and they eventually sold. Northwestern is one of the richest schools because of drugs called Lyrica was developed in the chemistry department. One of their presidents, a few years, a few presidents back, decided to sell half of the royalties. And that's, you know, why they became one of the richest schools.
Joe Weisenthal: Sorry, I'm just thinking more about that little exhibit on the Texas campus. There's the other thing. They're like black gold Texas tea, which they also said. I love that Texas tea.
Tracy Alloway: Why didn't we go see that exhibit.
Speaker A: When we were there?
Joe Weisenthal: Yeah, I don't know, but it's like one of those things where it's like, if you're a college student, you're, like, walking around and you may be, like, drunk at 11pm at night and you're like, walking through campus. Like, you stop there and the audio is playing, if I recall, like, 247 next to this pump. And it's like.
Tracy Alloway: I'm sure you're not speaking from personal experience.
Joe Weisenthal: Not really, but that's like a thing that you do. Okay, I get like, Texas has this big advantage because of this fluke gift from over 100 years ago. And they discovered all the oil and, you know, and the wind and solar coming up. But, like, it's not just that. They've done a good job, too, right?
Janet Lauren: Well, they're huge. I mean, it's a huge campus. And initially that money only funded two campuses. UT, Austin. And we can't forget about Texas A and M in College Station. They share that land. Two thirds goes to University of Texas at Austin, one third goes to Texas am. And they pool that money together, and it's invested in a company called utimco. Yeah, they follow the Harvard management company model and they created a separate company. And utimco is based in Austin. And, you know, if you're a hedge fund and you're visiting, you know, the big Texas pension funds, UTIMCO is there in Austin, so it would just be another place.
Joe Weisenthal: So, Tracy, because of my Texas roots and we're starting our odd lots multi strategy hedge fund, we would stop at utimco rather than Harvard. That would be our first stop. Rather than Harvard.
Tracy Alloway: It sounds like you just want to go to Texas.
Joe Weisenthal: Yeah, but I also want the money.
Tracy Alloway: Yeah. Okay. One thing I'm wondering is. So endowments are invested heavily in private equity, which we talked about. And it feels to me like there's a little bit more criticism of private equity right now than there used to be. There was a big piece in the Guardian about how private equity is like ruining the economy and things like that. Do you think there's going to be any pressure to divest from pe?
Janet Lauren: Well, I don't know that they would want to sell anything on the secondary market, but perhaps they may not want to re up and increase their allocation because at this point they're quite large. Harvard and Yale and Princeton, they're all around the 39% ish percentage. Part of the reason is again, I keep going back to 2021 when they had these crazy returns, but the value of their private equity books just really increased with those returns. So it's a bigger share of their endowment. And plus they've had great returns up until recently. And when you think of when David Swensen started investing in private equity decades ago, there wasn't that much money, so it was easier to get crazy returns as they did.

Joe Weisenthal: Podcasts, Spotify or anywhere you listen. So where are we in terms of the Biggest. How close are we towards my Utimco eclipsing Harvard management company? Like, what do we talk about here?
Janet Lauren: Well, it's hard to tell. I mean, if you look at how Harvard did in the last 10 years in their annualized returns, in the year that ended 2023, they were in the bottom 20%. So it's hard to tell. I mean, if you get another banner year with energy and they keep getting a couple billion dollars in cash, how.
Joe Weisenthal: Much literally is the gap? What do we know in terms of their size?
Janet Lauren: I don't know if I've seen what utimco's size is right now. You know, a couple billion here and there.
Joe Weisenthal: So we're close.
Tracy Alloway: Okay, so the other thing that's going on, speaking of public criticism, is some of the Israel, Palestine controversy that's happened at Harvard over the past year. Talk to us about that and what impact that's been having on donations.
Janet Lauren: So Harvard has been at the forefront of protests on campus. Like many schools, they had encampments. Theirs ended in the spring without police arrests. I think everybody was very happy about that. But there was a tremendous amount of criticism over the last year about how they've handled antisemitism on campus, protests, encampments. And alumni really mobilized and said, we're not donating in alumni. Very wealthy ones like Len Blavatnik, and just sort of your average Harvard alum said, we're not going to do this. And they're known for being amazing fundraisers. They've raised over a billion dollars every year since 2014. They usually raise the most, although Stanford has raised more in some years and donations were down 15% in the year ended in June. And when you think about when they were in the news so much at the end of December, remember there was that congressional hearing in December 5th with the presidents of Penn, MIT and Harvard. They were in the news nonstop until the end of December. She ultimately stepped down. Claudine Gay, the president, on January 2. But when do most people make their gifts to colleges? They make their gifts at the end of the calendar year, and that was not a great time for Harvard.
Joe Weisenthal: I just have one last question, and it's a little bit philosophical. Am I bad for not donating to my college? I had an amazing time at Texas. I mean, seriously, I had an amazing time at Texas. Nothing I actually learned led directly to a job, but it was a formative experience. I look back on it fondly. I've been very fortunate in my career since then. Many good things that have happened in my life Were roughly from that time that I spent there. Like, should I, like, think about this differently? Because when I look at it, it's like, here's, they have tons of money. They don't really need any more. Like, pitch me that. It's like a good idea.
Janet Lauren: Well, do you want to help students have a similar experience that you do?
Joe Weisenthal: They have tons of money.
Janet Lauren: I don't know, maybe there's something in particular you can tailor your donation to. Something specifically. I mean, and that's one of the.
Tracy Alloway: Things the podcast course.
Janet Lauren: Yeah, well, that's one of the things that Harvard, you know, complains about is a lot of their money is they say it's restricted.
Joe Weisenthal: Oh, yeah, right.
Janet Lauren: So if you give money to the crew team, they can't spend it in theory on the tennis team.
Joe Weisenthal: Right.
Janet Lauren: So you could say, I want to, you know, I want to give it to something and then there you go. It could be named after you if you want.
Joe Weisenthal: Maybe a little podcast studio at the J School.
Tracy Alloway: There you go.
Joe Weisenthal: Yeah.
Tracy Alloway: All right.
Janet Lauren: There you go.
Joe Weisenthal: Maybe that could work.
Janet Lauren: And one thing about these gifts is they're multi year, so you could make a pledge over 10 years or whatever the case.
Joe Weisenthal: I'm open to changing my mind on this, but I wrestle with it because just between the three of us here in the room, like, I think I have the number that, like, they call me on. Like, I either have it blocked or like I have, like it says, like, do not answer. I'm open to. I'm open to.
Janet Lauren: Like, that's kind of cruel.
Joe Weisenthal: That's. Yeah, I know. That's what I'm saying. I have a little issue. I have, I have some misgivings and I'm open to rethinking this question at this stage of my life. Janet, Lauren, thank you so much for coming on. I really appreciate it.
Janet Lauren: Thanks for having me.
Joe Weisenthal: It was a lot of fun. Thank you so much.
Tracy Alloway: Thank you, Janet.
Joe Weisenthal: Tracy, I am going to use this podcast for the most nakedly egregious, self serving purpose ever right now. And I just want everyone to be aware of that.
Tracy Alloway: Okay, wait, is it urging listeners to continue to support the pod so that you can make donations to students?
Joe Weisenthal: No, no, no. I'm like, open to rethinking my philosophy on donations because I probably, when I blocked the number, I was like, you know, much younger and earlier in my career. No, you know what I've thought? I can't believe I'm going to say this out loud. I've thought that a nice retirement job for me would be Being some sort of adjunct professor at the journalism school at ut and like, you know, I've done a lot in digital media and like may, through donations or something, find a way back into that community.
Tracy Alloway: Yeah. Start laying the groundwork now.
Joe Weisenthal: Basically start prepaying my salary, make a bunch of donations so that, you know, 20 years from now when we stop doing odd lots, there's like this pool of money that can fund my adjunct degree.
Tracy Alloway: Yeah.
Janet Lauren: Anyway.
Joe Weisenthal: Absolutely. But maybe someone will hear that and reach out. I'm just saying.
Tracy Alloway: Oh, don't go to Texas, Joe.
Joe Weisenthal: No, I'm not going. I'm just. Yeah, no, I won't. Okay. But I. But yeah, maybe someone will listen and at the University of Texas Journalism School and hear about my career in 20 years. In 20 years. Yeah. You know, one other thing though, for real, though, I think is really interesting about this and I hadn't realized is the difference in the corporate structure between the Harvard endowment and the Yale endowment. And so you can, and so anyone can just look at the Harvard endowment. Oh, why are you paying all these people so much? Have you heard Passive is the future? All these fees, and yet you could have another institution that's doing fantastically and no one sees how much they're paying managers or how much individual star traders are getting because those independent star traders are at the hedge funds that no one actually gets to see because they don't file some independent return.
Tracy Alloway: Speaking of transparency, I saw this really great chart in the Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, and it's the word count of the annual message.
Joe Weisenthal: I love that.
Tracy Alloway: From the Harvard Management Company CEO, the Endowment CEO. And I think it used to be like over 3,000 words typically, and now it's gone down to a little over 1000. Interesting. That's where a lot of the criticism of lack of transparency at Harvard comes from.
Joe Weisenthal: Yeah, well, you just get rid of all, you know, don't have any in house traders talking a thing and you just, you let the third party managers, the hedge funds be. Let them write the words in the letters. That's their job is to write words in the letters.
Tracy Alloway: That's right. Shall we leave it there?
Joe Weisenthal: Let's leave it there.
