## Portfolio Construction (trade-off)

### 1. Security Selection
1. **Top-Down Approach**
    - Start with entire economy
    - Work down to individual industries
    - Select best securities within each industry for client
2. **Bottom-Up Approach**
    - Begin with universe of securities (stocks/bonds/alternatives)
    - Select best securities for client
    - Group into industries and overall economic context
_Note: Both approaches start with the entire universe and narrow down to create an appropriate client portfolio._

### 2. Portfolio Optimization
- Based on Harry Markowitz's 1952 work
- Uses techniques like Monte Carlo simulation
- Focus on arranging securities in their optimal configuration

> Hey, it’s Jim, and this is Level Three of the CFA Program—a constructed response set on the topic of portfolio construction. Let me quickly remind you that we can essentially approach this in one of two ways when making the security selection decision: a top-down approach, where we start with the entire economy, work our way down to the individual industries that comprise it, and then find the best stocks, fixed-income securities, or alternative investments within each industry for our particular client; or a bottom-up approach, in which we begin with the universe of stocks, bonds, or alternative securities, select the best ones for our client, and then identify the best industries and, ultimately, the entire economy.
> 
> Notice that whether we use top-down or bottom-up, we start with the entire universe and work down to a portfolio appropriate for our client. Now, we won’t ask you about top-down or bottom-up in this constructed response set. However, I like to emphasize it as a theme throughout the CFA Program. You may not get a question on this particular learning module, but you’re sure to encounter it somewhere in the CFA Level Three exam.
> 
> After security selection, the next step is to arrange those securities optimally. Of course, this should make you think of Harry Markowitz, all the way back in 1952, although there are other methods like Monte Carlo simulation. We don’t specifically ask about Harry Markowitz here, but we do mention "optimization." I want to make sure you combine everything you've learned so that you’re well-prepared.
> 
> That was my brief introduction. Now, let's dive into these first two learning modules: an overview of equity and an overview of fixed-income portfolio management. Consider that the next slide will likely cover a sample equity portfolio, then a fixed-income portfolio, and we'll figure out what actions to take. Remember what we learned from Thomas Sowell, that there’s always a scarcity of resources and trade-offs, and that's the emphasis here—what are the trade-offs within the equity and fixed-income portfolios?

## Case Study: Oak Tree Capital

### Current Situation
- A global investment firm, Oaktree Capital Management, is reviewing its investment strategies across various
asset classes. The firm's Chief Investment Officer (CIO), Sarah Chen, optimizes their equity and
fixed-income portfolios.
- Employs mix of active management strategies

### Equity Portfolio Challenges
In the equity space, Oaktree employs a mix of active management strategies. Their large-cap equity fund has consistently underperformed its benchmark, the S&P 500, over the past five years. Sarah is considering shifting this portion of the portfolio to a more passive approach.
1. **Performance Issues**
    - Large-cap equity fund consistently underperforming S&P 500 benchmark
    - Considering whether the S&P 500 is the appropriate benchmark - it might be suitable for many portfolios but maybe not ours; thinking about shifting to a more passive approach. 
2. **Small Cap Equity Fund**
    - Uses quantitative factor-based strategy
    - Outperforming Russell 2000 benchmark
    - Shows significantly higher volatility by taking on extra risk
    - Considering whether it's worth it, which ties back to the efficient frontier in portfolio theory and whether pushing toward that northwest corner is worthwhile.
    - New Emerging Markets benchmarks - Evaluating three potential benchmarks:

| Index                 | 3-Year Annualized Return | 3-Year Standard Deviation | Correlation Coefficient with existing portfolio |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| MSCI Emerging Markets | 8.5%                     | 18.2%                     | 0.65                                            |
| FTSE Emerging Markets | 7.9%                     | 17.8%                     | 0.60                                            |
| S&P Emerging BMI      | 8.2%                     | 18.5%                     | 0.70                                            |

> Let’s set up this case. Here we are at Oak Tree Capital. We have a chief investment officer Sarah, and, as I mentioned, the concept of optimization appears here in equity and fixed-income portfolios. For equities, they employ a mix of active management strategies, meaning there’s potential for alpha. There’s mention of a benchmark that consistently underperformed the S&P 500. So, the first question is whether the S&P 500 is the appropriate benchmark—it might be suitable for many portfolios, but maybe not ours. We’re thinking about shifting to a more passive approach. 
> 
> For their small-cap equity fund, Oaktree uses a quantitative factor-based strategy that has outperformed its benchmark, the Russell 2000, by an average of 2% annually over the past 3 years. However, this outperformance has come with significantly higher volatility.. This is where Sowell’s notion of trade-offs comes in: while we achieve higher returns, we also take on extra risk. The question is whether it's worth it, which ties back to the efficient frontier in portfolio theory and whether pushing toward that northwest corner is worthwhile.
> 
> Next, Sarah is considering potential benchmarks for a new equity fund in emerging markets. Of the three options, what stands out? The MSCI has the highest return, a middle-level correlation coefficient, and a moderate standard deviation. The S&P Emerging has lower returns and a higher correlation. When you look at the MSCI versus the BMI, one of these could be inefficient—I’ll leave that for you to figure out before we get to the answers.

### Fixed Income Portfolio Challenges
#### Yield Curve Analysis
- Currently upward sloping
- Focus on roll-down return potential
#### Roll-Down Return Example:
1. Initial Setup:
    - 4-year bond with 4% coupon rate
    - Annual payments (40, 40, 40, 1040)
    - Upward sloping yield curve (1%, 2%, 3%, 4%)
2. Strategy:
    - Buy bond at ~$1,002
    - Hold for three years
    - Sell at ~$1,030 (assuming stable yield curve)
    - Profit from roll-down effect

| Maturity | Yield |
|----------|-------|
| 1 year   | 3.0%  |
| 2 years  | 3.2%  |
| 3 years  | 3.3%  |
| 5 years  | 3.4%  |
| 10 years | 3.5%  |

This represents an upward-sloping yield curve, where longer maturities have progressively higher yields. The steepest part of the curve is between 1-2 years (0.2% increase), and it gradually flattens out at longer maturities (only 0.1% increase from 5 to 10 years).

> In the fixed-income portfolio, the yield curve is upward sloping, so the question is how we might use its shape to enhance returns. There’s mention of roll-down return. With an upward-sloping yield curve, even if the slope is mild, you could achieve a roll-down return. Assume a four-year bond with a 4% coupon rate and annual payments. If you discount future cash flows at current spot rates, the bond’s price may be slightly above par. After three years, assuming the yield curve remains stable, you could sell it at a higher price, thus realizing a roll-down return, based on the assumption that the yield curve remains stable.
> 
> Lastly, Sarah explores leverage in Oaktree's fixed-income portfolios to enhance returns. She's particularly interested in using total return swaps but is concerned about the potential risks. In a team meeting, three of her colleagues presented different views on the risks:
> 	1. John (Risk Manager): "The primary risk of total return swaps is counterparty risk. If the counterparty defaults, we could lose the entire value of the swap."
> 	2. Emma (Portfolio Manager): "I believe the main risk is interest rate risk. If rates rise unexpectedly, the value of our swaps could decline significantly, leading to margin calls.
> 	3. Michael (Derivatives Specialist): "The biggest risk is basis risk. If the reference asset in the swap doesn't perfectly match the underlying portfolio, we could face unexpected losses."

Question 1 
- Discuss two rationales for Oaktree to maintain active management in their small-cap equity fund, despite the higher volatility.
- Explain why these rationales may not apply to their large-cap equity fund. (2 pts) 
- Note: Each explanation should be in a separate paragraph.

> [!note] Response
> - Potential for alpha generation:
> 	- Small-cap equities often exhibit inefficiencies and less coverage by analysts compared to large-cap stocks.
> 	- Provides a fertile ground for active management strategies to exploit these inefficiencies and generate alpha.
> 	- Oaktree has outperformed the Russell 2000 by an average of 2% annually, demonstrating the fund's ability to capitalize on these inefficiencies.
> - Customization and flexibility:
> 	- Active management allows for greater flexibility in adjusting the portfolio in response to changing market conditions, economic cycles, or shifts in the business landscape.

##### Information Inefficiency Advantage

The first compelling rationale for Oaktree to maintain active management in their small-cap equity fund stems from the significant information inefficiencies present in the small-cap market. Small-cap stocks typically receive limited analyst coverage, with most companies followed by only 3-5 analysts compared to the 20+ analysts covering large-cap stocks. This limited coverage, combined with lower institutional ownership and reduced media attention, creates natural information gaps in the market. These inefficiencies provide fertile ground for skilled active managers to conduct proprietary research and identify mispriced securities before the broader market recognizes their value. The fund's demonstrated ability to outperform the Russell 2000 by an average of 2% annually validates this approach, suggesting that the higher volatility is a necessary trade-off for capturing these alpha opportunities.

Consider a typical small-cap company like "SmallTech Solutions" (hypothetical), with a market cap of $500 million. This company might only be covered by three sell-side analysts, compared to a large-cap tech company like Microsoft, which has over 35 analysts providing regular coverage. When SmallTech announces a new patent for AI technology, it might take days or weeks for the market to fully appreciate its implications, creating a window of opportunity for active managers who have done their homework.

```text
SmallTech Solutions (Small-Cap):
- Market Cap: $500M
- Analyst Coverage: 3 analysts
- Trading Volume: 100,000 shares/day
- Time to Price Discovery: 3-5 days
- Information Sources: Limited quarterly calls, minimal news coverage

vs.

Microsoft (Large-Cap):
- Market Cap: $2.8T
- Analyst Coverage: 35+ analysts
- Trading Volume: 25M+ shares/day
- Time to Price Discovery: Minutes to hours
- Information Sources: Constant news coverage, multiple daily analyses
```

#### Strategic Flexibility Advantage

The second rationale centers on the strategic flexibility that active management provides in the small-cap space. Active managers can dynamically adjust their portfolios in response to changing market conditions, emerging opportunities, or evolving risk factors. This flexibility is particularly valuable in the small-cap segment, where position sizes are naturally smaller and managers can enter or exit positions with minimal market impact. The ability to actively manage position sizes and sector weightings allows the fund to capitalize on short-term market inefficiencies while maintaining risk control. During periods of market stress or significant economic shifts, this adaptability becomes especially valuable as managers can quickly reposition the portfolio to protect capital or seize new opportunities.

```text

Small-Cap Portfolio Example:
Initial Position: $5M position in regional bank stock (1% of fund)
Market Event: Federal Reserve announces unexpected rate change
Action Possible: Can exit entire position in 2-3 days with minimal impact
Trading Cost: Approximately 0.3% of position value

vs.

Large-Cap Portfolio:
Initial Position: $500M position in JPMorgan (1% of fund)
Market Event: Same Federal Reserve announcement
Action Limited: Would take 7-10 days to exit without significant impact
Trading Cost: Could exceed 1% of position value due to market impact

```

### Information Efficiency Barriers

In contrast, large-cap equities are typically well-covered by analysts and closely followed by investors, resulting in more efficient pricing. This high level of market efficiency reduces the potential for active managers to find mispriced securities and generate alpha. Oaktree's large-cap equity fund has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 benchmark over the past five years, suggesting that active management is less effective in this space. Therefore, shifting to a passive approach may be more appropriate for the large-cap fund, as the opportunities to exploit market inefficiencies are limited. Let's examine a real-world example of information dissemination:

```text
News Event Timeline Comparison:

Small-Cap Company (Revenue Warning):
Day 1: Company announces warning
Day 2-3: Limited analyst coverage, market still processing
Day 4-5: Broader market recognition
Day 7+: Full price adjustment complete

Large-Cap Company (Revenue Warning):
9:00 AM: Company announces warning
9:01 AM: High-frequency traders react
9:02 AM: Major news outlets publish analysis
9:30 AM: Market opens with price fully adjusted
```

#### Structural Limitations

Consider the practical implications of position sizing and market impact:

```text

Portfolio Adjustment Example:

Small-Cap Fund ($1B AUM):
- Want to build 1% position ($10M) in small-cap stock
- Stock trades $5M/day
- Can build position over 5-7 days
- Impact cost estimate: 0.2-0.3%

Large-Cap Fund ($50B AUM):
- Want to build 1% position ($500M) in large-cap stock
- Stock trades $500M/day
- Need 3-4 weeks to build position
- Impact cost estimate: 0.5-1%
```

Despite higher volatility, active management in the small-cap fund can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns. By selectively investing in small-cap stocks with strong growth potential, the fund can achieve returns that outweigh the additional risk taken. Active management allows for dynamic adjustments to the portfolio in response to market changes, aiming to optimize the trade-off between risk and return. This approach aligns with portfolio theory's efficient frontier concept, where moving toward the "northwest corner" represents higher expected returns for a given level of risk.

The large-cap equity fund has not realized higher risk-adjusted returns through active management, as evidenced by its consistent underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The large-cap market's efficiency limits the ability to achieve excess returns that justify the additional risk and costs associated with active management. Consequently, the pursuit of higher risk-adjusted returns through active strategies may not be viable in the large-cap space, and a passive approach that tracks the benchmark more closely could be more beneficial for investors.


However, these rationales lose their potency when applied to Oaktree's large-cap equity fund for several structural reasons. In the large-cap market, information efficiency is significantly higher due to extensive analyst coverage, sophisticated institutional investors, and constant media scrutiny. Most large-cap companies are followed by over 20 analysts, with real-time news coverage and high-frequency trading algorithms quickly incorporating new information into stock prices. This efficiency dramatically reduces the opportunity for active managers to develop meaningful information advantages or identify mispriced securities. The costs of generating alpha in this space often exceed the potential benefits, making it increasingly difficult to justify active management fees.

Furthermore, the structural limitations of large-cap investing severely restrict the benefits of active management flexibility. Large position sizes mean that meaningful portfolio adjustments often create significant market impact, potentially eroding any theoretical advantages before they can be realized. The universe of investable large-cap stocks is also more limited, making it challenging to significantly differentiate from benchmark indices without taking on excessive risk. Trading costs and liquidity considerations often force large-cap managers to maintain positions even when their investment thesis changes, limiting the practical benefits of theoretical flexibility.

The contrast between these market segments explains why higher volatility might be acceptable in small-cap active management but harder to justify in large-cap strategies. In small-caps, the higher volatility comes with a genuine opportunity to generate alpha through information advantages and tactical flexibility. However, in large-caps, similar levels of volatility often represent uncompensated risk, as the market's efficiency makes it exceedingly difficult to consistently generate returns that justify the additional volatility and higher costs of active management.


#### Risk-Return Implications







Question 2 
- Determine which of the three indices (MSCI Emerging Markets, FTSE Emerging Index, or S&P Emerging BMI) is the most appropriate benchmark for Oaktree's new emerging markets equity fund. Justify your choice. (4 pts)
	- MSCI Emerging Markets
	- FTSE Emerging Index
	- S&P Emerging BMI

Question 3
- Explain how the shape of the yield curve presented in the case information affects the potential for rolldown return. (3 pts)

Question 4
- Identify which of the three risks presented by Sarah's colleagues (John, Emma, or Michael) is the most significant when using total return swaps for leveraging fixed-income portfolios. Explain why this risk is the most significant, providing two supporting arguments. (3 pts)


### Risk Considerations

Three main types discussed:
1. **Counterparty Risk**
    - Most significant in OTC markets
    - Potential for total loss
    - Can lead to systemic risk
2. **Interest Rate Risk**
    - Can be managed through proper portfolio construction
    - Important but not primary concern
3. **Basis Risk**
    - Can be managed through careful selection of underlying swap portfolio
    - Less significant with proper management

## Key Takeaways
1. Active management can be justified despite higher volatility:
    - Less analyst coverage in small caps creates opportunities
    - Greater flexibility in portfolio management
2. Benchmark selection should balance:
    - Return potential
    - Risk characteristics
    - Correlation with portfolio
3. Risk management requires understanding tradeoffs:
    - Higher returns vs. volatility
    - Active vs. passive management
    - Risk types and their relative importance
- 
Lastly, three people make comments. You know that the Institute loves to ask whether you agree or disagree with various views. In this case, we’ll choose between John, Emma, and Michael, who suggest different types of risk: counterparty, interest rate, and basis risk. Now, let’s proceed with the four questions.

1. Two rationales for Oak Tree to maintain active management despite higher volatility: this is a trade-off question.
2. Which of the three indices should we pick? I mentioned this earlier.
3. How can the shape of the yield curve help us enhance returns?
4. Which risk is most significant among the three mentioned?
