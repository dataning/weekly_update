Imagine you're planning a road trip, and the conditions of the roads you'll travel on vary greatly. Traditional investment assets (like stocks and bonds) can be compared to standard cars, which perform well under normal conditions—think of a sunny day on a well-paved highway. These cars (or assets) are reliable and efficient when the weather is good and the roads are clear.

However, if the forecast predicts a shift to more challenging conditions, such as icy roads or heavy rain, relying solely on a standard car might not be ideal. This is similar to an economic environment with rising inflation. Just as a standard car struggles on slippery or rough roads, traditional assets can struggle during periods of high inflation. They may not provide the safety or performance needed to navigate through such economic changes effectively.

In this scenario, you'd be better off with a diversified fleet that includes vehicles designed for different conditions. This includes all-wheel drive SUVs, off-road capable vehicles, and perhaps vehicles equipped with features like snow tires and enhanced suspension. These vehicles are analogous to 'real assets' like REITs, infrastructure equities, and TIPS, as well as traditional inflation hedges like gold. These types of assets are specifically suited to handle the tougher conditions of rising inflation, providing better traction and stability—just as specialized vehicles handle adverse weather conditions better than standard cars.

So, just as you would select a vehicle based on the expected driving conditions, in times of inflation, an investor should consider adjusting their portfolio to include assets that are better equipped to perform under such economic pressures. This diversified approach helps ensure a smoother, safer journey through the uncertain terrain of the financial markets.

> With core inflation in the U.S. reaccelerating in the past six months and nearly approaching the Fed’s target of 2%, questions about the implications of this trend have become topical. If long-dormant inflation makes a lasting comeback, this would indeed represent a major regime shift in markets. Here, we explore empirical financial asset behavior in periods of higher inflation and lay out our preferred approach for constructing and managing a multi-asset inflation protection portfolio.
> 
> While not a foregone conclusion, it seems likely that inflation in the U.S. and globally has seen its low for this cycle. The output gap appears closed in 48% of the global economy, which suggests inflation is set to accelerate cyclically. Many of the structural disinflationary influences that have been present over the past three decades appear to have largely played out or even reversed. Furthermore, the possibility of dovish policy errors during the next downturn appear to have increased, as policymakers and academics have begun to debate aggressive policy tools like price-level targeting and government-sponsored jobs programs.

> What is an investor to do if this confluence of factors results in a sustained acceleration of inflation that ultimately leads to it remaining above the Fed’s 2% target for a considerable period of time?

> First, it is important to remind ourselves that traditional assets and traditional portfolios (such as those with dominant equity and bond allocations) would be vulnerable in an environment of rising inflation. Since 1973, during periods when inflation accelerated, U.S. government bond returns lagged inflation by 1%, while equities exceeded it by 3.3%. A traditional portfolio allocation of 60% U.S. equities and 40% U.S. government bonds outperformed inflation by just 1.6%. These traditional assets offered an unattractive risk vs. reward during this period (the 60/40 portfolio allocation offered only a 0.04x Sharpe ratio), as equities’ Sharpe ratio was only 0.13x. In times when inflation became a real threat—i.e. above 2% and accelerating—traditional assets performed even worse: bonds lagged inflation by 3.2%, equities beat it by only 1.4%, and a 60/40 portfolio allocation lagged it by 0.5%. (Extending the analysis back another 50 years to 1920, traditional assets also did somewhat poorly when inflation was above 2% and accelerating, producing 0.17x Sharpe ratio and outperforming inflation by only 0.4%). In other words, traditional assets historically have struggled to produce attractive returns when inflation was high.
> 
> As we wrote in May 2017 (see: “The Importance of 2%”) higher inflation would cause investors to reconsider the current orthodoxy of portfolio construction, where bonds have played an important role as diversifiers and deflation hedges. In recent years, bonds have been negatively correlated to equities, and thus cushioned downside in equity bear markets, which in a low-inflation environment, were usually triggered by deflation fears. But as inflation accelerates and exceeds 2%, higher inflation rather than deflation becomes a bigger risk. If inflation remains above 2%, bonds’ correlation to equities will likely revert to being positive, as it was in the three decades from the 1970s through the early 1990s when inflation was similarly above 2%. Bonds would lose their value as a diversifier and a hedge, likely exacerbating their negative performance in such a scenario.
> 
> While it may be relatively obvious that traditional assets perform poorly during accelerating inflation, and bonds would be particularly vulnerable, alternatives are less straightforward. It appears that consensus opinion has coalesced around hedging inflation with so called ‘real assets’ such as REITs and infrastructure equities, as well as conventional inflation hedges: gold and TIPS (treasury inflation-protected securities). It is true that these assets, in aggregate, have performed better than traditional assets during periods of accelerating inflation, and produced superior risk/reward characteristics than a portfolio with a traditional 60/40 allocation. Since 1973, an equal weighted basket of REITs, infrastructure stocks, U.S. 10-Year TIPS, gold and commodities outperformed inflation by about 9.6%, with an average Sharpe ratio of 0.76x when inflation accelerated. And each individually produced a better Sharpe ratio than either equities or bonds. During periods when inflation continued to accelerate above 2%, these assets also outperformed inflation by 10.3% with an average Sharpe ratio of 0.82x. In other words, these so called ‘real assets’ are justifiably perceived to have offered inflation protection in the past, and perhaps therefore are likely to help do so in the future.

1. **Discriminating Approach to Asset Analysis**: The strategy begins by taking a selective or discriminating approach to analyzing assets that might offer inflation protection. This means they don't just group all potential assets together but look closely at how each asset specifically reacts to inflation.
    
2. **Disaggregating Links Between Inflation and Asset Performance**: The approach involves breaking down (disaggregating) the relationship between inflation and how different assets perform. This allows for a more detailed understanding of which assets genuinely protect against inflation and which do not.
    
3. **Consideration of Other Macroeconomic Factors**: Besides just inflation, other significant economic indicators are also taken into account, such as overall economic growth conditions and real interest rates. This comprehensive view helps in choosing assets that not only hedge against inflation but are also suitable given the broader economic context.
    
4. **Asset Sensitivity to Inflation**: The strategy focuses on selecting assets expected to be most sensitive to inflation, thereby providing effective hedging properties. These assets are chosen based on their historical performance during inflationary periods and their overall fit with the current economic regime.
    
5. **Separating Effects on Cash Flows and Valuation**: When analyzing assets, there is an emphasis on distinguishing the impact of inflation on the cash flows generated by the asset from the impact on the asset’s valuation. For example, while equities can adjust prices and pass on costs (thus potentially increasing cash flows), their valuation might suffer due to inflation's impact on corporate costs and pricing power, making their link to inflation loose and unpredictable.
    
6. **Real Assets with Contractual Links to Inflation**: Certain assets like REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) or infrastructure stocks may have cash flows more directly or even contractually linked to inflation, making them initially seem like good inflation hedges. However, due to their long duration and high sensitivity to interest rates, they tend not to perform well or correlate strongly with inflation over time, particularly when interest rates are also rising.
    
7. **Preference for Specific Assets**: The preferred assets for inflation hedging in this strategy are Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), gold, and commodities (including energy and materials sector equities). These assets have historically shown a closer correlation with inflation and have provided better risk-adjusted returns during periods of accelerated inflation.
    
8. **Historical Performance**: The strategy highlights that since 1973, a portfolio of TIPS, gold, and commodities has not only outperformed inflation but also offered higher returns and better risk/reward characteristics compared to traditional and other real assets during periods of high or accelerating inflation.
    

In essence, this strategy is about carefully selecting assets that have proven effective in protecting against inflation while considering broader economic conditions and specific asset characteristics. It aims to optimize returns and minimize risks by focusing on assets that directly benefit from inflation, rather than those whose link to inflation might be indirect or inconsistent.


> We take what we think is a more discriminating approach to analyzing inflation protection assets. First, we disaggregate the links between inflation and asset performance. Second, we consider other significant macro factors, in addition to inflation. During inflationary periods, we see a marked difference in performance among inflation protection assets, based on overall growth conditions and the direction of real rates. We construct our hedge portfolio by focusing on assets that we expect to be most sensitive to inflation and selecting those most appropriate for the overall economic regime at the time. When we analyze linkages between asset performance and inflation, we prefer to separate the effect of inflation on cash flows from the effect on valuation. In principle, equities are a real asset, as companies can raise prices and pass on higher input costs. But because corporate pricing power and inflation’s impact on costs are variable and difficult to forecast, equity earnings empirically are only loosely linked to inflation. By contrast, many REITs or infrastructure companies may have cash flows that are more directly, or even contractually, linked to inflation. However, historically neither equities broadly, nor REITs nor infrastructure stocks specifically, has produced attractive returns or risk/reward characteristics in higher inflation environments or meaningful correlation to inflation because of inflation’s negative impact on their valuations. As long-duration assets, they tend to have a high sensitivity to discount rates and as such are sensitive to interest rates. This is why equity valuation multiples have tended to be negatively correlated to both inflation and interest rates. The historical correlation of REITs and infrastructure equities’ performance to 10-year rates has been fairly consistently negative for the same reason. In our opinion, this makes them somewhat less effective inflation hedges.

Since 1973, during periods when inflation accelerated, an equal-weighted portfolio allocation of these three assets outperformed inflation by 9.2% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.96x.11 During accelerating and above-2% inflation, this portfolio allocation outperformed inflation by 10.2% with a Sharpe ratio of 1.06x.12 This clearly exceeded returns and risk/reward offered by traditional assets as well as some other ‘real assets’ such as REITs and infrastructure stocks during periods of accelerating or high inflation (Display 1).


The portfolio allocation mentioned in the provided text focuses on diversifying investments into assets specifically chosen for their ability to hedge against inflation, particularly during times when inflation is accelerating or remains high. Here's a breakdown of how such a portfolio might be structured, based on the strategy outlined:

1. **Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)**: These are U.S. treasury securities adjusted to the Consumer Price Index, ensuring that they adjust for inflation and protect the real value of the investment. Allocating a portion of the portfolio to TIPS provides a direct hedge against inflation as the principal value of these bonds increases with inflation.
    
2. **Gold**: Historically, gold has been seen as a safe haven asset that typically appreciates during times of high inflation or economic uncertainty. Gold can serve as a non-yielding asset that often moves inversely to the U.S. dollar and can rise when inflation erodes the value of paper currency.
    
3. **Commodities**: Including physical commodities or equities related to commodities (such as those in the energy and materials sectors) can be effective. Commodities often see price increases in times of inflation, making them a natural hedge against inflation. Energy commodities like oil and natural gas, along with materials such as copper and aluminum, are typically sensitive to inflationary pressures.
    
4. **Energy and Materials Sector Equities**: Investments in stocks within sectors that are tied closely to commodities, such as energy (oil, gas, renewable energy companies) and materials (mining, metals, chemicals), can benefit from inflationary trends. These sectors often see their product prices increase with inflation, which can lead to higher profits and, consequently, higher stock prices.
    
5. **Diversification and Weighting**: The specific weighting of each asset class in the portfolio would depend on the current economic outlook, inflation forecasts, and individual risk tolerance. For example, during periods of anticipated high inflation, the portfolio might increase its exposure to TIPS and commodities. Conversely, if the inflation outlook is stable, the portfolio might maintain a more balanced approach with a significant allocation towards equities and perhaps a reduced emphasis on gold and commodities.
    
6. **Risk Management**: Each asset class has its risk profile and response to market changes, so managing the risk through diversification and periodic rebalancing is crucial. The portfolio should also be reviewed regularly to adjust the asset allocation based on changing economic indicators and inflation data.
    

This type of portfolio is designed to not only protect against inflation but also to take advantage of the opportunities that arise during inflationary periods. The goal is to achieve a balance that provides growth, income, and preservation of capital, aligning with the investor's financial goals and risk tolerance.
