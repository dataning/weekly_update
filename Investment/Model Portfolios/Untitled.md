**Multi Asset Fund or Model Portfolio?**

Multi asset funds and model portfolios both offer investors diversification, but there are key differences between the two.

**Structural Difference**

* In a multi asset fund, the investments that make up the fund are held by the fund.
* In a model portfolio, the underlying holdings are held by the investor directly.

**Implications for Costs**

* When choosing a solution for your clients, make sure to compare overall costs with a fund, including the stated ongoing charges figure.
* Model portfolio costs are not as easy to determine, as they include the manager's fee, charges from underlying investments, and potential dealing charges.

**Transparency**

* With a model portfolio, clients and their advisors can readily see all the underlying investments with every recent transaction itemized.
* Multi asset funds may not offer the same level of transparency, making it more difficult to see recent changes in the portfolio.

**Tax Considerations**

* Tax is payable on profits from both types of investments, but the timing of payment is an important consideration for some clients.
* Investors in model portfolios will be liable for capital gains tax when underlying investments are sold at a profit, while investors in multi asset funds pay capital gains tax only when they sell their investment in all or part of the fund.

**Platforms and Investment Options**

* Both funds and models are available on platforms, but platform technology may restrict the holding of certain investments within a model portfolio, such as investment trusts and ETFs.
* The structure of multi asset funds enables them to invest widely, including investments that might not be available on platforms, which can contribute to lower costs.

**Choosing the Right Solution**

* Suitability is not just about available assets, but also tax planning, costs, and the levels of reporting and diversification required by the client.
* Schroeder Investment Solutions offers a broad selection of both model portfolios and multi asset funds to suit clients across the full risk profile spectrum at a cost-effective rate.](<Multi asset fund or model portfolio?
