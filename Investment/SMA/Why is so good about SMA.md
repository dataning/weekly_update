Large pensions and endowments are increasingly using separately managed accounts (SMAs) to invest in hedge funds, borrowing the multi‑manager “pod” model. SMAs let them tailor risk controls, adjust exposures, see every underlying position, and negotiate fees directly—offering greater transparency and cost efficiency. This shift addresses the lack of visibility and control in traditional commingled funds, without trying to replicate the scale of giants like Millennium or Citadel.

### **Why SMAs Are Gaining Traction**
1. **Demand for Transparency**
    Allocators want to see exactly what they own—not just net fund returns—so they can monitor and manage portfolio exposures in real time.
2. **Risk‑Control Customization**    
    SMAs let each investor dial up or down specific risk factors (e.g. market, credit, volatility) rather than inheriting the fund’s blanket parameters.
3. **Fee Negotiation & Capital Efficiency**
    By contracting directly, large LPs can often negotiate lower fees or performance hurdles tailored to their size, and commit less capital to achieve target exposures.
4. **Alignment & Partnership**
    Managers who run SMAs typically take on fewer, more engaged LPs—allowing deeper strategic alignment and more flexible mandate terms.

### **When Commingled Funds Still Make Sense**
- **Smaller Allocators:** Don’t have the scale or internal resources to support bespoke account setups.
- **Broad Diversification Needs:** Want exposure to many strategies or pods without building and monitoring each relationship.
- **Operational Simplicity:** Prefer “plug‑and‑play” access with all back‑office, legal, and prime‑broker setup handled by the manager.
- **Cost Sensitivity at Lower AUM:** Benefit from pooled negotiating power on fees and expense ratios.

| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Transparency**            | • Managers report only high‑level metrics (e.g. net returns)   | • Full visibility into each underlying position and trade          |
| **Customization & Control** | • One‑size‑fits‑all strategy and risk parameters               | • Customize exposures, leverage, derivatives usage, ESG screens    |
| **Cost Structure**          | • Economies of scale often yield lower headline fees           | • Fee negotiation possible, but smaller AUM can mean higher fees   |
| **Minimum Capital**         | • Lower individual minimums (pooled capital)                   | • Typically higher account minimums to justify bespoke setup       |
| **Operational Complexity**  | • Manager handles all back‑office, prime‑broker setups, legal  | • LP needs infrastructure or platform to manage custody, reporting |
| **Diversification**         | • Broad pooling across many strategies/pods                    | • Depends on number of SMAs; can be narrower if too few managers   |
| **Liquidity & Terms**       | • Standardized gates, lock‑ups, redemption schedules           | • Can negotiate bespoke liquidity and redemption terms             |
| **Tax Efficiency**          | • Tax events are pooled; limited LP‑level planning             | • Potential for tax‑lot harvesting and asset‑by‑asset tax control  |
| **Scale & Access**          | • Access even for smaller allocators; managers built for scale | • Best suited to larger allocators; emerging managers may be open  |

- **Supermarket (Commingled Fund):** You pick up pre‑packaged, marinated BBQ steak that comes with clear labels—weight, calories, sodium, etc. It’s effortless: you know exactly what’s inside, it’s uniform, and you don’t need to ask any questions.
- **Butcher Shop (SMA):** You buy your steak cut‑to‑order — you can choose the exact size, the farm it comes from, even how it’s trimmed. You get full visibility and control over every detail, but you’ll have to estimate calories and nutrients yourself (they vary cut by cut) and do a bit more homework.

We’ve incorporated SMAs into our hedge‑fund sleeve, and it’s been transformative. First, we gain very granular transparency—down to the individual security level—so we understand exactly what our managers are doing. Second, SMAs allow us to match expected return profiles with roughly one‑third of the capital we’d need in a commingled fund, because we’re not paying for blind pool risk.

# OCIO view

## **1. Granular Transparency**  
**What it means:**
- With a commingled fund, you typically receive monthly or quarterly statements showing net returns, sector weights and broad risk metrics. Individual security positions—and the evolution of those positions over time—remain “behind the curtain.”
- An SMA, by contrast, delivers daily (or even intraday) visibility into every holding, every derivative line, every cash balance. You can see exactly which stocks were bought, at what price, and how exposures are shifting in real time.
**Why it matters:**
- **Risk management:** You can stress‑test the actual portfolio overnight or intraday—rather than estimating from aggregate exposures.
- **Regulatory & compliance:** For endowments or pensions with strict mandates around ESG, concentration limits or derivative usage, SMAs let you flag breaches immediately.
- **Performance attribution:** You can drill down to see which specific trades drove returns—critical for evaluating and coaching managers.
## **2. Capital Efficiency**  
**The one‑third rule:**
- In a pooled fund, the manager often holds extra cash buffers, posts collateral for counterparties on behalf of all LPs, and needs to carry liquidity for redemptions. That “blind‑pool” capital drag means you must commit, say, 100 units of capital to achieve a target level of market exposure.
- With an SMA you own only your slice of the collateral and margin—often requiring only 30–40 units of capital to replicate the same risk/return profile. You avoid funding your neighbor’s buffer, so your capital works harder.
**Real‑world impact:**
- **Return enhancement:** By deploying less cash to achieve the same strategy, your net returns (on deployed capital) can be meaningfully higher.
- **Opportunity cost:** Freed‑up capital can be re‑allocated to other opportunities—private equity, infrastructure, or even held in a short‑term cash vehicle for opportunistic trades.
## **3. Why SMAs Are Booming Again**  
1. **Manager Supply:**
    - Pod‑based firms (think multi‑strategy shops) trained hundreds of portfolio managers who struck out on their own. Many prefer running a $500 million SMA over chasing billions in a commingled flagship.
2. **Platform Technology:**
    - Firms such as Walleye, Enfusion or Confluence have built end‑to‑end systems: order management, execution algorithms, portfolio accounting, risk analytics and even single‑security P&L reporting. These platforms dramatically lower the operational barriers to launching and running SMAs.
3. **Internal Expertise:**
    - In the early days, only mega‑pensions with huge in‑house teams could handle the operational burden of SMAs. Now—even mid‑sized endowments and pension plans have dedicated risk, compliance and operations specialists who can oversee multiple SMAs in parallel, thanks in part to improved reporting interfaces.
## **4. What’s In It for Managers?**  
- **Deeper LP Relationships:** Managers trade off asset gathering for a smaller roster of highly engaged investors—reducing marketing time and client‑servicing overhead.
- **Aligned Economics:** Rather than “2% and 20%” on ever‑growing AUM, managers can negotiate performance fees more closely tied to delivered alpha.
- **Flexibility to Nurture Emerging Talent:** With daily transparency, allocators are comfortable allocating to newer managers on smaller mandates, helping incubate next‑generation talent.

---

**Mapping to Hedge‑Fund Vehicles:**

- **Commingled Fund = Supermarket:** A pooled vehicle where dozens (or hundreds) of investors’ capital is bundled together. The fund manager buys assets on behalf of everyone, then issues a single “nutrition label” (net returns, overall risk metrics). You get standard disclosures, easy sign‑ups, and scale‑driven cost efficiencies — but limited granularity and customization.
    
- **Separately Managed Account = Butcher Shop:** You contract one‑on‑one with a hedge‑fund manager or platform. They run a bespoke portfolio in your name, tailoring exposures, leverage, derivatives, even ESG screens to your exact specs. You see every position daily, negotiate fees and terms directly, and only commit the capital you need. The trade‑off is higher operational complexity (you—or a platform—must handle reporting, prime‑broker docs, etc.) and you give up some pooled economies of scale.

### **Is a Commingled Fund “Just” a Pooled Fund? How It Works**
1. **Capital Aggregation → Bulk Ordering at the Supermarket**: Investors each subscribe to the fund by wiring cash. Their money is merged into one large pool. 
    - We aggregate orders from shoppers across the region — everyone who wants BBQ steak contributes to the total volume. This lets supermarket place one large bulk order with the growers and processors, rather than many small, expensive ones.
2. **Unified Strategy:** -> **One Consistent Recipe**: The fund manager runs a single strategy — say, a long/short equity book—across the entire pool. All LPs share the same risk‑return profile. This means that if the pre-packaged meat is marinated BBQ source with 25 mins in the oven, you cannot change that. 
	- Develop a single, signature marinade and set a standard bake time (25 minutes) so that every package delivers the exact same flavor profile and texture. Shoppers know that, no matter which location they visit, they’ll get the same marinated chicken experience. 
3. **Standardized Terms & Fees:** -> **Uniform Pricing & Labeling**: Every investor signs the same Limited Partnership Agreement (or similar), with identical management and performance fees, liquidity windows, lock‑ups, and reporting schedules. Just like what you buy from supermarket, you get the same treatment. 
	- Each package carries the same nutrition facts, ingredient list, and retail price. We don’t negotiate bespoke discounts or custom labels for individual customers—everyone pays the same and sees the same clear information on calories, protein, sodium, and allergens.
4. **Economies of Scale:** - **Leverage Through Scale**: By pooling together, the fund can negotiate lower execution costs, prime‑broker rates, and legal fees—benefits that are harder to achieve in standalone accounts. THis is why it's more scable for the supermarkets. 
	- Because we buy in huge quantities, we negotiate lower costs on feed, packaging, shipping, and labor. Those savings help us keep price tags competitive and maintain consistent stock levels across all stores, even during peak barbecue season.
5. **“Black Box” Reporting:** -> **Streamlined Reporting**: Investors receive periodic statements showing net returns, aggregated risk metrics, and maybe high‑level sector or position breakdowns—but they don’t see every underlying trade in real time.
	- Internally, our operations team tracks overall sales, spoilage rates, and supplier performance. Externally, customers see only the label—they know the key facts (price, nutrition), but not the exact sourcing details or day‑to‑day kitchen operations. This “black‑box” approach simplifies shopping for them, while allowing us to manage complexity behind the scenes.

# Commingled Fund is same as a Pooled Fund? Any distinction of both two?

A “commingled fund” is essentially one flavor of “pooled fund,” but the term “pooled fund” is broader. Here’s how they relate—and where you might see subtle distinctions:
1. **Pooled Fund (Umbrella Term)**
    - **Definition:** Any investment vehicle that gathers capital from multiple investors into one pot.        
    - **Examples:** Mutual funds, exchange‑traded funds (ETFs), collective investment trusts, unit trusts, hedge funds, private‐equity funds, common‐law trusts, etc.
    - **Characteristics:** Can be regulated (e.g. UCITS, mutual funds) or unregulated (certain private vehicles); may offer daily liquidity or have lock‑ups; fees and reporting vary widely.
2. **Commingled Fund (Subtype of Pooled Fund)**
    - **Definition:** A pooled vehicle — typically managed by a bank, trust company, or registered adviser—where client assets are blended together in a single account or omnibus structure.
    - **Common Uses:** Defined‑benefit pension plans, endowments, foundations, or other large institutional investors often use commingled vehicles to gain scale, reporting consistency, and cost efficiencies.
    - **Characteristics:**        
        - Often structured as a collective trust or common trust fund (CTF) under bank or trust fiduciary rules.
        - May have more flexible terms than mutual funds (e.g. custom liquidity gates, fewer regulatory disclosures).
        - Usually available only to institutional or tax‑exempt investors (not retail).

Great question — and you’re absolutely right. In **multi-asset portfolios blending SMAs and pooled funds**, two major challenges come up consistently:


## **🔍 1. Look-Through (Transparency)**

**Definition:**
“Look-through” refers to the investor’s ability to **see and analyze the underlying holdings and exposures** within each investment vehicle.
### **Application in the DataFrame Example:**

| **Vehicle Type** | **Look-Through Quality** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SMA**          | ✅ High                   | With SMAs like _Alpha Global_ or _CreditX SMA_, you typically have full transparency into positions, sector weights, risk exposures, etc. You can see exactly what you own.                                |
| **Pooled Fund**  | ❌ Low                    | With pooled funds like _EM Growth Partners_ or _MultiCap Fund LP_, you’re usually investing in a blind pool. The manager may provide quarterly updates, but real-time position-level transparency is rare. |
|                  |                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

**Challenge:**
In a commingled fund, you might know you have 10% in “Emerging Markets,” but:
- What sectors? What countries? What currency exposure?
- Are you doubling down on a risk factor you already have elsewhere?

Without look-through, **aggregate portfolio risk can be hard to manage**, especially across overlapping exposures.

---

## **📊 2. Performance Attribution**

  

**Definition:**

Performance attribution is the process of breaking down returns into **component sources**: asset class, strategy, manager skill, factor tilts, etc.

  

### **Application in the DataFrame Example:**

  

Suppose your **Public Equity portfolio** returned 10%. That 10% could come from:

|**Strategy**|**Vehicle**|**Return (%)**|**Attribution Clarity**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Global Long/Short (SMA)|Alpha Global|+12%|✅ High — you can attribute return to individual stocks, sectors, factors|
|Emerging Markets (Pooled)|EM Growth Partners|+8%|❌ Low — you only know overall return, not which countries or stocks drove it|

**With SMAs:**

- You can run performance attribution by sector, country, style factor (value/growth), currency, etc.
    
- You can adjust exposures more proactively based on what’s working.
    

  

**With Pooled Funds:**

- You might only get gross/net performance and a quarterly letter.
    
- Attribution is often _manager-dependent_ and may lack granularity or timeliness.
    

---

## **🔄 Combined Struggle**

  

When you blend both in a portfolio:

|**Problem**|**Result**|
|---|---|
|Inconsistent transparency|Makes it hard to evaluate whether an overweight in tech is deliberate or incidental|
|Limited pooled fund attribution|Impairs your ability to isolate alpha vs beta, or to reallocate effectively|
|Time lags in data|Especially in private assets and hedge funds, slows down the investment committee’s ability to act|

  

---

## **Example Visualization:**

  

Imagine this return summary across your portfolio:

|**Asset Class**|**Vehicle Type**|**Return (%)**|**Can Attribute?**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Public Equity|SMA|+12%|✅ Yes|
|Public Equity|Pooled Fund|+8%|❌ No|
|Credit|SMA|+10%|✅ Yes|
|Hedge Funds|Pooled Fund|+7%|❌ No|
|Hedge Funds|SMA|+9%|✅ Yes|
|Real Assets|Pooled Fund|+11%|❌ No|
|Real Assets|SMA|+13%|✅ Yes|

As you can see, you get a more actionable and risk-aware picture of performance from SMAs — but pooled funds require more inference, trust, or estimation models.

---

## **🧠 Final Takeaway:**

  

> **SMA = Clarity. Pooled Fund = Convenience.**

> But when you’re trying to manage risk, rebalance, or explain performance to a board — _clarity wins._

  

If you want, I can show how to simulate attribution using this example portfolio or set up a scoring system for transparency + attribution.

**HOST:** And that actually dovetails with a great story on the Bloomberg Terminal today. Hemmer Palmer, our hedge fund reporter, wrote it—it’s about how a lot of pensions and endowments are borrowing the playbook from giant multi-manager hedge funds. We’re talking about separately managed accounts (SMAs).

Now, SMAs aren’t new, but the fact that institutions are embracing them more broadly really caught my attention. Why is that?

**Hemmer Palmer:** Yeah, it’s very interesting. We’re seeing some of the largest pensions and endowments take inspiration from multi-strategy hedge fund firms in how they structure their investments. Increasingly, they’re using SMAs to invest in hedge funds. With SMAs, they get greater control over risk management, full transparency, and in some cases, lower costs. They can tailor the investment to their specific needs, which allows them to capture some of the benefits that large “pod shop” firms enjoy.

**HOST:** So is this a reflection that, in the past, they weren’t getting the transparency or control they wanted?

**Hemmer Palmer:** Exactly. Traditional commingled hedge funds didn’t offer that level of visibility or customization. To be clear, they’re not trying to mimic or compete with giants like Millennium or Citadel—those firms are massive and complex, with hundreds of pods. But these institutional investors are saying, “We can adopt elements of that model to improve how we invest, with more specificity and better oversight.”

**HOST:** One of the people you quoted in the story is Ann Marie, Chief Investment Officer for Private Markets and Funds Alpha at the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. She joins us now. That’s a $156 billion fund, and she oversees more than $70 billion of that. Ann Marie, I’ll admit this wasn’t really on my radar until the story dropped. How exactly has Wisconsin utilized SMAs?


**ANN MARIE:** We’ve used them as part of our hedge fund allocation, and it’s been a great addition in several ways. First, as Hemmer mentioned, transparency—we get much closer to the assets and what the managers are actually doing. Second, we’ve been able to reduce the amount of capital we need to allocate while still achieving our expected returns. We can use about a third of the capital compared to a commingled fund and get similar return potential.

**HOST:** So you’re saying this is not only more transparent, but also more cost-effective and capital-efficient?

**ANN MARIE:** Yes. That’s right. Now, we still maintain some commingled hedge fund investments because they have their own advantages. But SMAs are proving to be a more capital-efficient space where we’re generating very strong returns.

**HOST:** SMAs first gained popularity after the financial crisis and the Madoff scandal. What’s making them even more attractive now?

**ANN MARIE:** Three things, really.
- First, we’re seeing more hedge fund talent interested in running SMAs—often individuals trained at pod shops who are now launching their own firms and are open to SMA structures.
- Second, the technology has improved dramatically. As mentioned in the article, we work with a group called Darkside, affiliated with a multi-manager firm called Walleye. They’ve built excellent technology, and we’re able to piggyback off those advances.
- Third, our internal team has matured significantly. We have strong manager selection capabilities and even a risk expert who used to run risk for a hedge fund. That in-house expertise is a big enabler.

**HOST:** And from the hedge fund manager’s perspective—SMAs can be more burdensome than a typical commingled fund. So what’s motivating them?

**ANN MARIE:** It really depends on the manager. Some aren’t looking to gather a huge amount of assets—they prefer deeper, more strategic partnerships with a smaller number of institutional investors. We’re a great solution for them because we can get them up and running quickly. Since we have daily transparency into the portfolio, we’re able to take more risk, both in terms of the parameters we give managers and in working with emerging managers we might not consider in a blind-pool structure.

**HOST:** I’m curious, though—how scalable is this? I always thought SMAs required a certain size and scale to make the numbers work. Can mid-size or smaller funds follow this trend?

**ANN MARIE:** It’s becoming more accessible, but some hurdles remain. You still need in-house expertise—particularly around manager selection and risk oversight. That said, platforms like the one we use help a lot. They handle things like negotiating derivatives and prime broker agreements.

While this used to be an option only for the mega-funds, I think it’s now trickling down to mid-sized funds. Probably not yet for the smallest ones, but as technology improves, more investors in that middle tier will be able to take advantage.
