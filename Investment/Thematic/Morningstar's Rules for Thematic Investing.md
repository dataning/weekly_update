Morningstar defines thematic investing as a way to capitalize on major trends or ideas by grouping investments around a specific theme. Here’s a simpler breakdown of how they decide what counts as a thematic fund:

#### 1. **Focus on Trends**:
   - Thematic investments are centered around big trends or changes, like new technologies, demographic shifts, or societal changes.
   - For example, investing in funds related to the legalization of cannabis or the rise of artificial intelligence would be considered thematic.

#### 2. **What’s Included**:
   - **Equity Funds Only**: Morningstar only considers stock (equity) funds because they are better suited to benefit from emerging trends.
   - **Sustainable Funds**: These are included if they focus on a specific trend, like funds investing in alternative energy to support the move to a low-carbon world.
   - **Specific Themes**: Funds that clearly target a specific theme are included, even if they use advanced tools like AI for choosing stocks, as long as they stick to the theme.

#### 3. **What’s Left Out**:
   - **Non-Equity Funds**: Bonds and other non-stock funds are excluded because they don’t align well with capturing the growth of new trends.
   - **Broad ESG Funds**: Funds that select stocks based on general environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria but don’t focus on a specific theme are not included.
   - **Gender Diversity ETFs**: Even though they seem thematic, these funds are excluded because they aim to promote a wide range of companies based on gender diversity, not a specific trend.
   - **Sector Funds**: Traditional sector funds, especially in areas like technology, are excluded unless they specifically target new or disruptive technologies.

#### 4. **Changing Over Time**:
   - Themes can evolve, and what starts as a thematic fund might later become more mainstream and lose its thematic status.

#### 5. **Thematic Categories**:
   - **Technology**: Includes themes like Fintech, Robotics, and Automation.
   - **Physical World**: Focuses on managing physical resources, such as alternative energy.
   - **Social**: Covers societal changes, like demographic shifts or political developments.
   - **Broad Thematic**: Groups funds that target multiple themes from the above categories.

#### 6. **Sub-Themes**:
   - Each broad category has more specific sub-themes. For instance, the Technology theme might include digital payments and blockchain, while the Social theme might include trends like the New Silk Road initiative.

In summary, Morningstar defines thematic investing as focusing on funds that aim to benefit from big, transformative trends, whether they are in technology, society, or the environment. They only include funds that clearly target these themes, mostly focusing on equity funds, and exclude broader or more general investment approaches.

To be fair, I just wanted to highlight the person who came in for the cleaning has done a wonderful job - tidying up things and making things very nice. Really appreciate this. I don't want this to go unnoticed given all other chaos.
