Simple or discrete returns are not symmetrical; positive simple returns are simply not equivalent in absolute impact to negative simple returns of the same absolute size. For example, if a positive return of 10% is followed by a negative return of 10% the combined return over both periods is (1.1 × 0.9) − 1 = −1.0%, not 0.0%. In other words, and somewhat counter- intuitively, if a portfolio increases by a given return and then decreases by that same return, it does not return to its starting value. This is because the second “equivalent” return starts from a higher absolute base and therefore does not result in the same absolute change.

The continuously compounded return required to achieve an effective return of 12% is there- fore the natural logarithm of the wealth ratio: ln(1.12) = 11.333%.

Nominal rates at different compounding frequencies that give the same effective rate of 12.0% are shown in Table 3.1.

The main advantage of continuously compounded returns is that they are additive. The total return can be calculated as follows:

ln(1+r) = ln(1+r1)+ln(1+r2) +···+(1+rn)

### Continuously compounded returns have the advantage of being:

(1) Additive (over multiple periods) 
(2) Symmetric  
(3) Normally distributed

### Simple or discrete returns have the advantage of:

(1) Being simple to calculate  
(2) Allowing aggregation across the portfolio  
(3) Being widely understood and used by both asset owners and asset managers
