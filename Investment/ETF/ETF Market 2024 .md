> BlackRock Flexible Income ETF BINC and Schwab High Yield Bond ETF SCYB stand on the shoulders of giants, ultimately improving ETF investors’ options without creating something original.

The phrase "stand on the shoulders of giants" in this context means that the BlackRock Flexible Income ETF (BINC) and the Schwab High Yield Bond ETF (SCYB) are building upon the foundational work and innovations that previous ETFs have established. This metaphor suggests that these newer ETFs are benefiting from the advances and successes of their predecessors in the ETF market.

By saying that these ETFs improve investors’ options "without creating something original," it indicates that while BINC and SCYB might offer better features or refinements—such as improved returns, lower fees, better risk management, or access to specific markets—they do not necessarily introduce brand new concepts or revolutionary changes to the ETF structure itself. They optimize the existing tools and strategies rather than invent new ones, thus expanding investor choices through enhancement rather than innovation.

### Comparison of BlackRock Flexible Income ETF (BINC) and Schwab High Yield Bond ETF (SCYB)

#### Investment Strategy

- **BlackRock Flexible Income ETF (BINC)**:
    
    - This is an actively managed ETF, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on market conditions. Managed by Rick Rieder, a recognized star manager, it targets more complex or less accessible fixed-income sectors such as global credit, securitized debt, and emerging-markets sovereign debt. The active management approach is geared towards adapting allocation and duration based on ongoing bond market analysis.
- **Schwab High Yield Bond ETF (SCYB)**:
    
    - SCYB is an index-tracking ETF that focuses on providing broad exposure to the high-yield bond market at a low cost. Schwab has positioned itself in niche bond markets, like high-yield bonds, only recently, maintaining a focus on cost-effectiveness. The fund aims to track a market index rather than outperform it through active management.

#### Fee Structure

- **BINC**:
    
    - Charges a 0.40% fee, which, while higher than many index ETFs, offers a lower-cost alternative compared to investor share classes of similar mutual funds managed by Rick Rieder.
- **SCYB**:
    
    - Initially launched with a 0.10% expense ratio, which was quickly reduced to 0.03% in response to competitive pressures. This aggressive fee reduction is part of what's dubbed the "Schwab Effect," where Schwab's entry into a market segment leads to widespread fee cuts across the industry.


#### Market Impact and Innovation

- **BINC**:
    
    - Represents the next stage in the evolution of ETFs by blending the appeal of ETFs (like tax efficiency and liquidity) with the sophisticated strategies typically found in active management. BINC's approach of reaching harder-to-access sectors could attract investors looking for diversified income sources.
- **SCYB**:
    
    - Demonstrates that even in a traditionally index-focused ETF landscape, there's room for fee innovation and enhancement. By entering high-yield bond markets with competitively low fees, Schwab has forced overall market fee reductions, benefiting a broader range of investors and shaking up the status quo.

#### Investor Benefits

- Both ETFs enhance investor options in the fixed-income ETF market:
    - **BINC** offers a managed approach that can adapt to changing market conditions, potentially providing higher returns at a moderate fee.
    - **SCYB** increases accessibility to high-yield bonds through its low-cost structure, encouraging more investors to consider high-yield bonds as part of their portfolios.

### Given the fee advantage, what's the advantage of BINC over SCYB? 

Despite the higher fees associated with the BlackRock Flexible Income ETF (BINC), there are several compelling reasons why investors might still prefer it over lower-cost options like the Schwab High Yield Bond ETF (SCYB) or other index-tracking ETFs:

1. **Active Management by a Renowned Expert**:
    - BINC is managed by Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income and a winner of Morningstar’s 2023 Outstanding Portfolio Manager award. Rieder's expertise and successful track record in managing fixed-income investments are a significant draw for investors who value professional management and believe in the potential for active strategies to outperform the market.

1. **Access to Specialized Markets**:
    - BINC targets harder-to-reach sectors within the fixed-income market, such as global credit, securitized debt, and emerging-markets sovereign debt. These areas can offer higher yields and diversification benefits but may be less accessible through typical index funds. Investors looking for exposure to these niche markets might find BINC particularly attractive.
        - **Global Credit**
			- **Definition**: Global credit refers to bonds issued by corporations and governments around the world, not limited to a single country or region. This includes corporate bonds, government bonds, and other debt instruments issued in various international markets.
			- **Why Harder-to-Reach**: Investing in global credit involves navigating different countries' regulatory environments, economic conditions, and currency risks. It requires a deep understanding of international markets and the ability to manage cross-border complexities, which can be challenging for individual investors or smaller funds.
		- **Securitized Debt**
			- **Definition**: Securitized debt involves financial instruments that are created by pooling various types of contractual debt such as mortgages, auto loans, or credit card receivables, and then selling the consolidated debt as bonds to investors. Common forms of securitized debt include mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS).
			- **Why Harder-to-Reach**: Securitized debt instruments can be complex, with structures that require sophisticated analysis to understand the underlying assets and their associated risks. These investments often demand expertise in assessing the quality of the pooled assets and the legal and financial intricacies of the securitization process.
		- **Emerging-Markets Sovereign Debt**
			- **Definition**: Emerging-markets sovereign debt refers to bonds issued by the governments of developing countries. These countries are typically characterized by faster economic growth and greater potential for investment returns, but also higher risks.
			- **Why Harder-to-Reach**: Investing in emerging-markets sovereign debt involves significant challenges, including political instability, economic volatility, and currency fluctuations. Additionally, the creditworthiness of these governments can vary widely, requiring extensive research and risk assessment. The market for these bonds may also be less liquid compared to bonds from developed countries, making it harder to buy and sell them.
		- Summary: **BlackRock Flexible Income ETF (BINC)** targets these harder-to-reach sectors within the fixed-income market because they can offer higher yields and diversification benefits that aren't typically found in more accessible sectors like domestic government or high-grade corporate bonds. By investing in global credit, securitized debt, and emerging-markets sovereign debt, BINC aims to tap into unique opportunities that require specialized knowledge and expertise to navigate effectively. This approach allows the ETF to potentially generate higher returns and provide broader diversification for investors who are looking for more sophisticated fixed-income strategies.

1. **Adaptability to Market Conditions**:
    - The active management approach allows BINC to adjust its holdings based on changing market conditions. This flexibility can be especially valuable in volatile or uncertain economic environments where fixed income investments might need more frequent adjustments to optimize returns and manage risk.

1. **Potential for Higher Returns**:
    - Active management strategies, like those employed by BINC, aim to achieve higher returns than the market average by making strategic investment choices. While higher fees can offset some of these gains, the potential for above-market returns can justify the cost for many investors.

1. **Lower Relative Fees Compared to Mutual Funds**:
    - While BINC's fees are higher than those of many index ETFs, they are still typically lower than those of actively managed mutual funds, especially those managed by high-profile managers like Rick Rieder. Investors might consider BINC a cost-effective alternative to similar mutual funds.

1. **High Ratings for People and Process**:
    
    - BINC has received high ratings for its management team and investment process, indicating a strong level of trust in its operational and strategic framework. For investors who prioritize governance and strategy, these ratings can be a decisive factor.

In summary, while fees are an important consideration, they are just one part of the investment decision. For many investors, the advantages provided by experienced management, strategic flexibility, access to specialized sectors, and the potential for higher returns are worth the extra cost associated with an ETF like BINC.




It seems that with every great leap in technology comes the
fear that machines will replace us (at best) or will lead to our
destruction (at worst). For baby boomers, the machine takeover
is epitomized by HAL, the computer antagonist in "2001: A
Space Odyssey" that refuses the commands of a stranded
astronaut to "open the pod bay doors." HAL's response, "I'm
sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that," still sends chills. There
are countless other examples for every generation to latch on
to, all with the same message: Beware of new technology. It's
hard not to feel threatened by something that has the
capability of transforming our world, whether we want it to or
not. Often our minds race to the worst possible scenarios, and
we dread outcomes before they have come close to realization,
forgetting the immense number of positive developments
innovations produce.

Remember when the great fear was that robo-advisors were
going to replace human advisors? It didn't turn out that way. In
a discussion with Morningstar's Julie Willoughby and Ben
Johnson, Andrew Brzezinski, Fidelity's head of data strategy,
says that the robos were "naive" about people's complex
financial situations ("Decoding Al Uses"). "That human element
... just couldn't be replaced by technology," he says. Still, robo-
advice has an important role to play— even if it isn't putting
advisors out of work.

We believe the same will hold true for artificial intelligence. As
Sheryl Rowling argues in our lead Spotlight article, "Advisors
Need to Embrace Al — but Carefully,", Al will be transformative
in ways we don't yet fully understand. Advisors need to be
cautious in these early stages, but everyone should view it as a
way to better serve clients. "Al will supplement advisors,
making them more efficient," tech expert Joel Bruckenstein
tells Rowling. "By streamlining back-office tasks, advisors will
have more client-facing time."
