### Numerical Example of Creation Units in ETFs with Math:

Let’s break down the numbers and math behind how an ETF uses creation units to meet demand and stay efficient.

#### Scenario:
- The ETF currently has **1,000,000 shares** available on the market.
- Each ETF share is trading at **$100**.
- The ETF holds **$100 million** worth of stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.), so its NAV is **$100** per share.

#### Increased Demand:
- Investors want to buy an additional **500,000 shares** of the ETF.

#### Step 1: **Authorized Participant Buys Underlying Stocks**
- To create new ETF shares, the authorized participant (AP) needs to buy a basket of stocks that matches the ETF’s holdings.
- Let’s assume the basket includes:
  - **Apple**: 50,000 shares at **$300** per share = **$15,000,000**
  - **Microsoft**: 30,000 shares at **$250** per share = **$7,500,000**
  - **Amazon**: 20,000 shares at **$1350** per share = **$27,000,000**
- **Total value of the stocks** purchased = **$50,000,000**

#### Step 2: **Creation of New ETF Shares**
- The AP gives the ETF provider these stocks worth **$50,000,000**.
- In return, the ETF provider creates **500,000 new ETF shares**, each valued at **$100** (because NAV = $50,000,000 / 500,000 shares).
- **500,000 new shares** are added to the market.

#### Step 3: **Selling ETF Shares**
- The AP now sells these **500,000 ETF shares** on the stock exchange at **$100 per share**.
- **Total revenue** from selling the ETF shares = **500,000 shares x $100/share** = **$50,000,000**.

#### Final ETF Position:

1. **Total ETF Shares Available**:
   - Original shares: **1,000,000**
   - New shares created: **500,000**
   - **Total shares after creation**: **1,500,000**

2. **NAV and Price Alignment**:
   - The ETF’s total assets (stocks) now equal **$150,000,000** (original $100M + new $50M).
   - With **1,500,000 shares** outstanding, the NAV remains at **$100 per share**.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - No stocks were sold for cash, so no capital gains taxes were triggered during the creation process.
   - ETF investors do not face unexpected tax liabilities.

### **Summary of Math**:
- **$50,000,000** in stocks was exchanged for **500,000 ETF shares**.
- The total ETF shares increased to **1,500,000**, keeping the NAV and trading price at **$100**.
- This process ensured liquidity, fair pricing, and tax efficiency, demonstrating why ETFs can be more advantageous than mutual funds.
