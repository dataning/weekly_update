Imagine you and several other investors have money in a mutual fund. One day, some of the investors decide to sell their shares in the mutual fund. To give them their money, the mutual fund manager has to sell some of the investments (like stocks or bonds) within the fund. If those investments have gone up in value since they were bought, selling them will create a capital gain. By law, the mutual fund must pass this gain on to all the investors in the fund, including you—even if you didn’t sell any of your shares. This means you might have to pay taxes on a gain you didn’t directly benefit from.

Now, let’s look at an ETF. Suppose the same situation happens: some investors want to sell their ETF shares. However, instead of the ETF selling the underlying investments (which could trigger capital gains), the ETF uses what’s called an “in-kind” transaction. This means the ETF transfers the actual stocks or bonds to a special middleman (called an authorized participant) in exchange for the ETF shares. Because the ETF isn’t selling anything for cash, no capital gain is realized, and no taxable event is created. As a result, you, as an ETF investor, don’t get hit with unexpected taxes.
