What differentiates a high net worth individual from other banking customers?

> **Alexandra** (St James): So I think what differentiates the customers is the level of investable wealth they have that naturally brings with it an increased level of complexity really around the advice and the services that they need and the range and breadth of the services that they expect.

How do you think perhaps one of the ways in which these individuals have more complex needs is around the cash management side of things? What do you see coming through with your customers?

>**Giles:** So I think in a single word answer, the word time is always at the forefront. So our clients just don't have time to manage multiple counterparties, have multiple relationships. They would like frankly as few points of contact as possible and for those points of contact to be as sophisticated as possible to be able to answer as many questions as possible. So in the old days, whatever that means, if you wanted multiple bank accounts, you had to open up several accounts and that includes a huge amount of paraphernalia, a huge amount of pain from an account application process. And like other industries, platformization, which is a horrible but appropriate word, comes along and allows high net worth clients to save huge amounts of time by accessing multiple product providers through a single interface.

**Daniel:** Well, I think it's important to recognize there are two main approaches to personalization. One is this human-centered approach where you have a personal advisor you can build a relationship with and sit down with face to face. The other is a technology-first approach where a system can be built which can take into account the individual requirements and criteria of each individual investor and cater to their needs. So, I mean, the market is a very big one. There's different people, we need different types of services. But the automation in our approach in particular is a way that we can provide this level of service to the wider market and provide the same types of tools that high net worths have traditionally had access to.


The needs of wealthy individuals include:
- **Management of Multiple Assets**: Wealthy individuals often have numerous dependent staff, properties, and other significant assets that require comprehensive management.
- **Complex Lifestyle Requirements**: They may need to handle various logistical concerns such as moorings for boats and managing different properties across multiple locations.
- **Business-like Complexity**: Their financial and asset management needs can resemble those of running a small business due to the sheer volume and variety of assets.
- **Custom Mental Models**: Wealthy individuals have unique ways of organizing and viewing their assets and financial goals, which can vary by geography, person, goals, or outcomes.
- **Personalized Relationship Management**: They require relationship managers who can understand their unique mental models and have meaningful conversations about their finances and goals.
- **Sophisticated Digital Interfaces**: There is a need for digital tools that can logically and effectively present complex financial information tailored to their diverse and intricate lifestyles.

> “You might have, as a really simple individual, and I'm going to refer to myself, I don't have a huge number of dependent staff or properties or different places where I'm jetting off throughout the year. And that is because I'm not a millionaire, sadly. But if all of the above are concerns for people who perhaps have the means and I guess, the ability to have people working for them, need to have moorings for a boat, need to have various different properties to manage, it does start to become like a small business. And then when you factor in the idea that some of the things I've just named are assets in their own right, the complexities there become huge. And I think we've seen as well that a lot of individuals we've spoken to, they all have a slightly different mental model of how they like to bucket up and see these different areas of their lives, whether that's practically by geography or by person or by whatever it might be, or whether it's a line to goals or outcomes. You need to start to create these systems that make it very easy for not just a relationship manager to have those conversations and be able to pick up and understand how someone thinks of their money and the goals they have.But also when it comes to digital interfaces, and I know we'll get on to this, that you have the complexity of having to present that information in a logical way for people whose lives are completely different.


different risk appetite
> 
> “I was going to comment as well that I think one of the things that makes this segment of the market very different is that they have potentially a different risk appetite, but also, as Alexandra mentioned, more capacity to invest. So they have the ability to segregate their investments or cash management or property or whatever there is and to manage them all individually. So I don't think there's necessarily a one-stop shop that will meet the needs of these clients in entirety.”

API as service
> “If we allow them to access our service through, for example, their financial advisors software, their front end, then they can see everything in one place. Why would they want to check their equity portfolio in one place and check their cash portfolio in another? It doesn't make any sense at all. “So we think of this as savings as a service. You embed your own service into other people's front ends. You have distribution channels as a business, but more importantly, the client has a much more efficient interface.”

Family office style - trust, safe, relevant and simple
> I think the analogy in reality is a family office approach. So there's three things that high network clients want to do. They want to work with somebody they trust. They want their assets to be kept safe, and they want the service and proposition bespoke to them. And it's on that latter point where I think the technology really comes in to enable firms to do that. It's value first, discount second with these clients. They're happy to pay as long as they're getting the services that they need. They want simple admin.”

> “Overcommunication is a real problem. They want to be... The communication has to be spoken relevant to them.”

How people acquire their wealth as to how they understand financial products and services
> 
> “It depends how people acquire their wealth as to how they understand financial products and services. So there's going to be a broad range of understandings in this market.
> 
> “You know, lottery winners, moneyed individuals, a new generation of gamers, sports and entertainment. It's enormously varied. And they genuinely all want to be serviced and advised in a way that's bespoke to them. I think the difference is in financial education as well. So we have high-net-worth clients who are financially sophisticated. They understand the banking system. They understand FSES protection, etc. But we also have clients who have been through a liquidity event. As Alexandra mentioned, there may be a business sale. There may be an inheritance, whatever the source of wealth is. And that individual may not be used to having a large amount of cash in their bank account. So that takes a very different type of client service from just the user experience. There's actually the financial education of what the service is before you start talking about your own business. So I think there's a very important financial education piece there for people who are experiencing that injection of liquidity for the first time.

“I think it's about five trillion pounds is going to change hands to create millennial millionaires. Now, whether that's accurate or not, this great wealth transfer is going to create a bunch of people who, again, it starts to be believed, are going to be looking to switch wealth advice based on the idea that they don't want that perceived to be stuffy relationship that perhaps a parent had, and they don't want that quarterly PDF because their expectations of what that service is going to be is not set by probably other banks on their phone or what they've been used to. It's the best always on informative, intuitive, predictive technology that they've got from other parts of their lifestyle.”



The goal is to increase the likelihood of getting better ctalents into the intern/graduate pipeline - when I say better, I am implicitly focused finding more individuals who have a good baseline of technicality, communication and personality. This means that if we get 10 people coming to our door, we would like to get at least 70%-80% of them are closed to the borderline. The way to achieve that it's to be proactive in sampling talents from a wider pool like reaching out to those degree course directors from top 20 universities aligned to AFE's need.

“But also I think technology lowers, if you like, the barrier to entry to this whole discussion. So I think Alexandra mentioned the family office concept. What investible assets do you have to have to qualify for kind of family office infrastructure, whatever that looks like.”

“I'm interested in is I guess as we see all sorts of different types of assets, it suddenly becomes from a product design perspective a whole new challenge of trying to represent investments that actually people feel quite passionate and personal about.”


“You've got, I guess, passive AI, which is going to make intelligent decisions for how to optimize your money. And then you've got AI that will provide you advice and you act upon that. And then genuinely trying to remove manual processes from probably the day-to-day cash flow of things.”
