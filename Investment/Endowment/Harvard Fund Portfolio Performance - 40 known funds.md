| **Vintage Year**                      | The year the fund held its first close (i.e. started investing)                                                                                | Older vintages have had more time to call capital and realize exits; very young funds may show low distributions simply because they’re still deploying capital.               |
| **Called %**                          | Called Capital ÷ Committed Capital — the percentage of total investor commitments the GP has drawn down                                        | • **High (> 80 %)**: the fund is deep into its investment program.   • **Low (< 50 %)**: still in early deployment, or a fund with a long-hold strategy.                       |
| **DPI %**(Distributions to Paid-in)   | Cumulative Distributions ÷ Called Capital — the share of called capital that has actually been returned to LPs via cash or stock distributions | • **> 100 %** (e.g. 120 %): LPs have received more than they put in so far—solid realized performance.   • **0–50 %**: few realizations yet; typical for mid-life funds.       |
| **RVPI %**(Residual Value to Paid-in) | NAV of Remaining Portfolio ÷ Called Capital — the unrealized value still held in the fund                                                      | • **High (e.g. 200 %)**: lots of paper gains still in the portfolio.   • **Low (< 50 %)**: either the fund has distributed most assets or the remaining ones are written down. |
| **Net IRR %**                         | The fund’s internal rate of return (net of fees and carried interest) on all cash flows to date                                                | • A true apples-to-apples return-speed measure.   • Higher is better; “good” IRRs in private equity historically range from ~12–20 %, but depend on vintage and strategy.      |
| **Net Multiple (×)**                  | (Distributions + NAV) ÷ Called Capital — total value delivered plus still-held value, per dollar invested                                      | • **1.0×** means you’ve merely gotten your capital back on paper.   • **2.0×** means you’ve doubled your money in combined realized and unrealized value.                      |
| **Median Benchmark Net IRR %**        | The midpoint IRR for a peer group of similar vintage and strategy funds                                                                        | • If your fund’s Net IRR (say 18 %) exceeds its benchmark (say 14 %), it’s outperforming the peer median.                                                                      |
| **Quartile**                          | The ranking of the fund versus its peer group, broken into four equal groups (1st through 4th quartile)                                        | • **1st quartile** — top 25 % of peers.   • **4th quartile** — bottom 25 %.                                                                                                    |

### **Tying it together**
- A fund with **high “seeds planted” (Called ≥ 80 %)**, **big “harvest eaten” (DPI > 100 %)**, **modest “crops in field” (RVPI)**, **fast “growth rate” (IRR)**, and **strong “total yield” (Multiple)** is like a farm that’s planted most of its seed, already eaten more food than it planted, still has some crops growing, and is outperforming its neighbors on both speed and total harvest.
- A younger fund (low Called %) is like a newly seeded field—plenty of potential, but little eaten harvest yet.
    

Using this “farm” metaphor helps you see:
- **What stage** the fund is in (planting vs. harvesting),
- **How much** you’ve eaten (realized gains) vs. what’s still ripening (unrealized), and
- **How well** you did relative to other farmers (peer‐group benchmarks).

### **1. Seeds Bought vs. Seeds Planted**
- **Called 111.3 %** → You bought 100 bags of seed, and then over-planted a bit (maybe re-used some seed varieties), sowing 111 bags into the ground.
- **Metaphor:** Your farm is fully planted—no field left empty.
    
### **2. Harvest Already Eaten**
- **DPI 143.3 %** → Out of those 111 bags you planted, you’ve already harvested and eaten the equivalent of 159 bags of crop.
- **Metaphor:** You’ve already reaped more food than the seed you sowed—you’re feasting!
    
### **3. Crops Still Growing**
- **RVPI 6.4 %** → Only 7 bags’ worth of crops remain in the field, still growing or waiting to be harvested.
- **Metaphor:** The vast majority of your crop is in your granary; only a small patch is left unharvested.
    
### **4. Crop Growth Rate**
- **Net IRR 13.1 %** → Your farm’s annual “food‐production growth rate” is 13 percent, once you account for all costs (tools, labor, spoilage).
- **Metaphor:** Year after year, every 100 kernels planted turned into 113 kernels of edible yield.
    
### **5. Total Yield per Seed Packet**
- **Net Multiple 1.50×** → For every 1 bag of seed you planted, you’ve produced (ate + stored) 1.5 bags of crop overall.
- **Metaphor:** You got one and a half times your seed back in actual food.
    
### **6. How You Stack Up**
- **Benchmark IRR 13.1 % & 2nd Quartile** → The median neighboring farm (same crop, same year) also grows at 13.1 percent; you’re in the second-best quarter of farms.
- **Metaphor:** You’re doing solid work—better than half your neighbors, but not quite among the top 25 percent of farmers.
    
---

#### **Farm Summary**

- You’ve **planted fully**, **harvested more than you sowed**, and **have almost no crop left** to pick.
- Your **growth rate** matches the average farmer’s, and your **total yield** (1.5×) is respectable but not extraordinary.
- Overall, it’s a **healthy, reliable farm**—you’ve fed your community well, but you haven’t broken any records this season.
