A passively managed portfolio, such as an indexed buy-and-hold portfolio, seeks to match the return of an index or a benchmark without engaging in active trading that attempts to generate improved performance. An actively managed portfolio involves trading with the intent of generating improved performance. Active investment man- agement may be viewed as generating active risk and active return.

Active risk is the risk that an actively managed portfolio contains as the portfolio manager endeavors to beat the returns of a benchmark. The variation in performance can be attributed to systematic risk that differs from the benchmark and from idiosyncratic risk. Active return is the expected or consistently realized return from active management relative to a passively managed portfolio or the benchmark.

Index products take little or no active risk, extract no added value, and are not expected to generate active return. They do not attempt to exploit information to earn higher returns but passively capture the risk premium associated with a risky asset class. Included in this group are most ETFs and other replication products designed to efficiently capture systematic risk premiums.
