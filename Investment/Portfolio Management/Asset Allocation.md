### Tactical asset allocation

Tactical asset allocation is the process by which asset managers seek to add value for asset owners by moving away from the strategic asset allocation (policy- or liability-driven bench- mark) for periods of time to take advantage of valuation anomalies across the different asset classes, within limits defined by the asset owner.
