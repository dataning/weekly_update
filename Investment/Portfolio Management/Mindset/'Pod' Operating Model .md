- The hedge fund allocates capital to multiple independent investment teams or 'pods'.[2]
- Each pod is responsible for a specific set of stocks or strategies and must remain beta neutral to the broader market.[2]
- Pods are given strict risk limitations like dollar neutrality or factor neutrality across their portfolios.[2]
- This model aims to systematically capture manager skill and alpha that can't be replicated by quantitative models.[2]
- Advantages include scale, ability to hire top talent, sophisticated risk analytics, and operational efficiency.[2]
- Commonly used by large multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, Millennium, Balyasny, Point72 etc.[2]

The 'pod' model has become increasingly popular for running long/short equity strategies at large hedge funds. It allows funds to hire specialized stock-pickers while maintaining a diversified and risk-controlled portfolio overall.[2][3]
