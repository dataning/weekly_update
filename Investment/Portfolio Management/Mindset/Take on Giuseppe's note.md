## Portfolio Manager vs. Data Scientist
This reminds me the 'pod' operation in hedge funds
> [!summary]
> - ** Role of Data Scientists **
> 	- Fundamental teams are hiring "data scientists" to meet new challenges.
> 	- These data scientists need to combine quantitative rigor and technical expertise with the investment process.
> 	- Their responsibilities often include testing new data sources, running optimizations, and testing hypotheses formulated by the portfolio manager.
> - ** Role of Portfolio Manager **
> 	- The portfolio manager constructs the portfolio and supervises the data scientist's actions.
> 	- The portfolio manager possesses knowledge in alphas, portfolio construction, risk management, and data, which are deeply interconnected.
> 	- A good portfolio manager can be – and should be! – a good risk manager, too.
> 	- The success of a strategy relies on the portfolio manager's competency and knowledge of these topics.

## Mindset of A Good Portfolio Manager
> [!important] 
> - ** Feynman approach **
> 	- It is possible to explain the basics of a systematic approach to portfolio construction without resorting to advanced mathematics and requiring much preexisting knowledge. Breaking down ideas into their most fundamental components and using clear, straightforward language to make them accessible to a broader audience.
> - ** Being a practitioner with skin in the game is the best approach — don't just observe. **
> 	- Despite the importance of portfolio construction, many books on the subject exist, yet none can be wholeheartedly recommended after years of experience as a quantitative researcher and consultant. Real-world finance, much like Renaissance Italian art, is learned through apprenticeship. Practitioners gain knowledge through hands-on experience and by engaging with other risk-takers.
> 	- Portfolio managers are trusted more than those who have never managed a portfolio. There's a strong incentive to protect one's edge by not sharing knowledge with outsiders, which prevents the existence of a truly comprehensive book on portfolio construction.
> - ** Honest about your knowledge and decision boundary **
> 	- Perhaps the simplest and deepest challenge is to understand the limits of your knowledge.
> - ** Internal drivers with situational contextual drivers **
> 	- When you form an opinion about the value of a company, you're also forming an opinion about its competitors because all valuation judgments are relative. The key question is, "Relative to what?" The aim is to understand the common factors that drive returns, not just the returns we can predict through detailed analysis of a single company. Then, measure performance against these common factors.
> 		- The first is an improvement in the alpha research process. If you know what the environment is, then you know if a bet on a partic- ular company carries with it unintended bets. Separating the stock from the environment gives you clarity of thought.
> 		- The second is an improvement in the risk management process. If you know your environment, you can control your risk much more effectively; specifically, you can effectively reduce the environmen- tal risk and keep only your intended bets; you can hedge out what you don’t know.
> - ** There is no master theory of portfolio management yet. **
> 	- There are problems and technologies that partially solve these problems. Theories come and go, but a solution to a real problem is forever.
> 	- As you explore portfolio management, you will find papers on optimization, position sizing, exploratory analysis of alternative data, and timing of factors.
> 	- Keep in mind the maxim paraphrased from a seminal paper on reproducible research: "An article about the theory of portfolio management is not the scholarship itself; it is merely advertising of the scholarship." [Buckheit and Donoho, 1995]
> 	- Always look for simulation-based validations of a theory, question the soundness of the assumptions in the simulation, and look for empirical tests based on historical data. Historical tests are most interesting when they show the limits of applicability of the theory, not when they confirm it [López de Prado, 2020].
> - ** Post-mortem analysis **
> 	- According to Plato, Socrates famously told the jury that sentenced him to death that “the unexamined life is not worth living”. Billions of people happily live their unexamined yet worthy lives, but not many portfolio managers survive for long without examining their strategies.
> 	- If you want to remain among the (professionally) living, you must make a habit of periodically revisiting your decisions and learning from them. The life of the good portfolio manager is one marked by continuous self-doubt and adaptation. The distinctive features of a strategy’s performance are stock selection, position sizing, and tim- ing skills. The challenge is how to quantify them and improve upon them.
