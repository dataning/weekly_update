# What is RAC (regional allocation council)?

The Council consists of senior investors across Solutions who are responsible and accountable for delivering positive alpha, and are supported by junior researchers. The Council leverages BlackRock's collective intelligence to define views and tilts applicable to SAAs. The following slide details the investment process to generate these views. The Council takes views on asset classes that are commonly held in strategic asset allocations. These views typically have a time horizon of 6-12 months.

# Why RAC?

The addition of these tactical asset allocation views are expected to increase portfolio risk- adjusted returns through the addition of a diversified alpha stream to the SAA, dynamically seeking favourable assets or managing risks in periods of volatility.

# Process

- The Council produces conviction scores across a range of assets which are translated into a long/short model portfolio. 
- The objective of the long/short model is to deliver 30-50 bps of return while targeting 50- 150 bps of active risk. 
- Client CIOs, together with the portfolio management team, are responsible for the application of the long/short model across client specific portfolios, taking into account constraints. 
- The Council produces periodic content that outlines its views on the economy, markets and specific assets as represented by the Asset Class View table.

# RAC process

Step 1: Generate tactical alpha through macro cycle and market pricing and sentiment
- The RAC seeks to estimate and forecast the economic cycle and determine whether this is discounted in market valuations. Sentiment data is used to assist with timing the implementation of market views. 
- The three pillars driving RAC views are the Economic Cycle, Valuation, and Sentiment Indicators.
	- Economic Cycle - characterised by growth, inflation, and policy - are key drivers of asset prices. We seek to identify the stage of the economic cycle and its future direction.![[Screenshot 2022-12-25 at 18.58.17.png]]
	- Valuation - Robust measures of valuation have strong predictive power on returns in nearly all asset classes. Valuations are used to determine whether asset classes accurately discount economic outlook.![[Screenshot 2022-12-25 at 18.58.37.png]]
	- Sentiment is leveraged to identify opportune times to express economic views - for example are markets oversold in times of stress when valuations are attractive.![[Screenshot 2022-12-25 at 18.58.58.png]]

Step2: incorporate systematic and discretionary insights across these three pillars
- provide below examples of systematic and discretionary insights across these three pillars. 
- convert asset class views into a model portfolio through rigorous portfolio construction and risk analysis

Economic Cycle
- FMOM: Three measures of earnings momentum aggregated by region 
- Proprietary Leading Economic Indicators 
- Monetary and Fiscal Policy

Valuation
- Various Valuation Metrics (e.g. Forward PE, Credit Spreads) 
- Arbitrage Pricing Theory: Multifactor asset pricing model to capture future returns based on current valuations 
- Price to Book Reversion: Buy countries where stocks are relatively cheap

Sentiment
- News Sentiment: Captures news and managers' sentiment 
- Industry Positioning and Flow Data

RAC investment view generated -> View translated to specific client portfolio -> OCIO specific macro inputs -> transition into funds -> Ongoing governance review
