To engage in TAA activities, an investor needs to hold specific investment beliefs about the nature of the inefficiency of capital markets.

Attractiveness of asset classes? What if the price is reasonably priced out?
> 1. TAA takes positions based on the relative attractiveness of asset classes. It is necessary to therefore believe that asset classes are inefficiently priced relative to one another and the inefficiency can be exploited.

In a way, it's to determine the misalignment within the asset class
> 2. It is not necessary to believe that every security within an asset class is accurately priced. It is possible for investors to incorrectly price equity and bond markets within a country, or even across countries, while every security within the asset class is priced accurately. This may be a reasonable belief to hold, since obtaining good-quality information on many markets and asset classes can be a challenge, especially given the different accounting, taxation, and regulatory environments. However, the degree of global financial integration and free flow of information, the rise of GTAA managers to exploit such inefficiencies may suggest greater relative asset class efficiency. The belief in this inefficiency is ultimately a matter of investor judgment.

Again, it's about misalignment
> 3. The equity risk premium varies over time, and this variation is exploit- able. In efficiently priced markets, asset classes are correctly priced relative to their riskiness. Riskier asset classes are therefore priced to deliver higher expected returns compared to less risky asset classes. Therefore, the equity market will offer a return premium (equity risk premium) to compensate investors for the greater risk they need to bear. However, it is necessary to believe that the equity risk premium deviates from its long-term level. When the equity risk premium is high relative to its long-term level, equities will be attractive to buy, and vice versa.

# Condition for sucess

Unstable market condition, volatility between asset classes and low correlation between asset classes.
> - For a TAA manager to add significant value depends on the extent of asset class mispricing. The more extreme market mispricing the greater the opportunity. The extent of mispricing, how long it lasts, and the speed with which prices revert to valuations are subject to a great deal of uncertainty.
> 
> - Volatility between asset classes is an important determinant of whether the TAA manager’s positions will be rewarded. The lower the volatility differences, the smaller the value-added is likely to be.  
> 
> - Correlations among asset classes needs to high for value to be added. Relative movement among asset classes is necessary for the TAA manager’s positions to pay off. If the correlation between asset classes is high, the value-added would be low.
