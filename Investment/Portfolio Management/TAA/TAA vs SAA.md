# SAA
> - It specifies a static mix of asset classes that is intended to be a long-term plan that best meet the investor’s objectives. It is often considered to be the principal determinant of long-term portfolio performance.
> - It is based on long-run relationships among asset class returns and the behavior of the investor’s liabilities.
> - It is established to be a long-term benchmark against which all asset deviations, at the asset class and security level, are measured.
> - It acts as a behavioural discipline by providing an anchor against the temptation to follow short-term trends in market returns.

TAA
> - Unlike the SAA, which is based on long-run relationships between asset classes, TAA seeks to systematically adjust a fund’s asset mix away from the SAA when asset classes are believed to be priced away from long-run relationships.
> - It is usual that TAA seeks to shift asset class exposures anticipating a return to long-run relationships. TAA will tend to sell asset classes that have strengthened and buy asset classes that have weakened. TAA will tend to be contrarian in nature.
> - TAA is usually undertaken by managers with relevant experience and skills to predict shorter-term market movements. The SAA is established by the investor and is a long-term benchmark against which the value- add from TAA can be measured.
