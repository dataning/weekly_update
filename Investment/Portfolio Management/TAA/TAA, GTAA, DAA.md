The terms global TAA (GTAA) and dynamic asset allocation (DAA) have gained prominence recently. The terms TAA, GTAA, and DAA are some- times used interchangeably, although there are differences.

The difference between TAA and GTAA, DAA
> TAA historically arose from specialist managers who allocated across domestic asset classes. TAA usually involves a few number of asset classes over which positions are taken. The downside of TAA tends to be the low number of portfolio positions. This means that errors in forecasting asset class relationships cannot be adequately diversified, resulting in volatile performance patterns.
> 
> GTAA strategies attempt to overcome the low number of positions in TAA strategies by increasing the number of asset classes involved and diversifying positions. GTAA strategies extend beyond domestic asset classes and cover a wide range of equities, bond, and currency markets. The degree of complexity in GTAA approaches also tends to increase. Increased complexity comes from a greater level of resource and expertise involved in assessing the risks and returns of a greater number of markets, each with different accounting, reporting, and taxation systems.
> 
> DAA is a term that has gained recent prominence. It is used in a variety of contexts and therefore lacks precise definition. However, the intent be- hind the term is usually a desire by investors, both retail and institutional, to adjust the mix of assets in their SAAs. It is more akin to TAA than to GTAA.
