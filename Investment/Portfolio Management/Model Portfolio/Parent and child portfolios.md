> In model portfolio management, a parent portfolio is the main portfolio that is managed by an investment manager or financial advisor. The parent portfolio may contain a variety of different assets, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, and is designed to meet the specific investment goals of the client. The parent portfolio may be divided into several sub-portfolios, or "child" portfolios, each of which has its own investment strategy and asset allocation. The child portfolios may be created to cater to the specific needs and risk tolerances of different groups of clients or to pursue different investment objectives. The investment manager or financial advisor may use a variety of tools, such as financial modeling and portfolio optimization techniques, to manage the parent portfolio and ensure that it meets the client's investment goals.

Parent Portfolio:

-   Asset Allocation: 60% stocks, 30% bonds, 10% cash
-   Investment Goals: Growth and income
-   Target Client: Moderate risk tolerance

Child Portfolio 1:

-   Asset Allocation: 75% stocks, 25% bonds
-   Investment Goals: Growth
-   Target Client: High risk tolerance

Child Portfolio 2:

-   Asset Allocation: 50% stocks, 50% bonds
-   Investment Goals: Income and stability
-   Target Client: Low risk tolerance

In this example, the parent portfolio is designed to achieve a balance of growth and income, and is suitable for clients with a moderate risk tolerance. The first child portfolio is more aggressive, with a higher allocation to stocks and a higher risk profile, and is suitable for clients with a higher risk tolerance. The second child portfolio is more conservative, with a balanced allocation between stocks and bonds and a lower risk profile, and is suitable for clients with a lower risk tolerance. The investment manager or financial advisor would use a variety of tools to manage the parent portfolio and ensure that it meets the investment goals of the clients, and would also use different strategies to manage the child portfolios based on the specific investment goals and risk tolerances of the clients in each child portfolio.

# Are they correlated? 

In general, the assets within a parent portfolio and its child portfolios will be correlated to some degree, since they are all managed by the same investment manager or financial advisor and are likely to be influenced by similar market forces. However, the degree of correlation will depend on the specific investment strategies and asset allocations of the parent portfolio and each child portfolio. For example, if the parent portfolio and child portfolios all have a similar asset allocation and are invested in a similar set of assets, they may be highly correlated. On the other hand, if the child portfolios have different asset allocations and are invested in different sets of assets, they may be less correlated with the parent portfolio and with each other.

It is important to note that diversification, or the use of a variety of assets with low correlations, can be an important risk management strategy in portfolio management. By diversifying a portfolio across a range of assets with low correlations, an investor can potentially reduce the overall risk of the portfolio. This is one reason why model portfolio management often involves creating a number of different child portfolios with different investment strategies and asset allocations, in order to provide clients with a range of options that may be suitable for their specific investment goals and risk tolerances.

# How do we come up with parent and child portfolios?

In model portfolio management, the investment manager or financial advisor typically begins by creating a parent portfolio that is designed to meet the specific investment goals and risk tolerances of the client. The asset allocation of the parent portfolio will depend on the investment goals and risk tolerances of the client, as well as on a variety of other factors such as the client's age, time horizon, and tax situation.

Once the parent portfolio has been established, the investment manager or financial advisor may create one or more child portfolios that are derived from the parent portfolio. The child portfolios may have different asset allocations and investment strategies, and may be designed to cater to the specific needs and risk tolerances of different groups of clients or to pursue different investment objectives.

To determine the allocation of the investment among the parent and child portfolios, the investment manager or financial advisor would typically consider the investment goals and risk tolerances of the client, as well as a variety of other factors such as the client's age, time horizon, and tax situation. For example, if the client has a moderate risk tolerance and is looking for a balance of growth and income, the investment manager or financial advisor might allocate the investment equally between the parent portfolio and one or more child portfolios with similar investment strategies and asset allocations. On the other hand, if the client has a higher risk tolerance and is looking for growth, the investment manager or financial advisor might allocate a larger portion of the investment to a child portfolio with a higher allocation to stocks and a higher risk profile.
