let's look at etfs compared to a couple other securities and as i said etfs are becoming very popular they do have very good marketing but there are a lot of situations where you're probably better off using a different instrument um not a lot of situations some situations so let's go through we're going to look at equities funds etfs and LICS 

so LICS is a closed end fund at the end of the day we'll get to what that means all right 

so let's talk transaction costs so this is where funds are very different so anything that trades on an exchange you're going to generally pay a transaction cost. You have to trade it through your broker depends upon what broker broker you have, what that cost will be but nevertheless there's mostly a cost there's also buy sell spreads, so that's just the mechanism that you buy and sell anything on an exchange is. there's going to be a difference between what you can buy something and what you can sell something for and that's obviously how everyone makes money in that

funds you don't have brokerage so that's the advantage of funds so if we think about the implications of this number one is that if you are making lots of contributions for instance if you want to put a monthly contribution and invest it funds are probably better off for you because you don't have to pay those transaction fees so once and funds and we'll get into some of the other attributes about funds but that's something for people who are saving paycheck to paycheck which is how most people save so something to think about you don't have to keep paying those transaction fees next thing we'll go down to management fees so of course these are all professionally managed products whether they're active or passive you have to pay management fees so they're done obviously for equities but funds generally have slightly higher management fees and the reason for that is there's a lot of fund administration that's involved with managing a fund and transacting in a fund so you'll generally pay slightly more of a fee um and then licks you generally pay slightly more as well valuation method so this is important we'll get into this a little bit when we talk about trading so funds always transact at the net present value the net asset value the nav so what that means is that at the end of every day fund accountants will go and they'll add up all the securities that are actually held in there they'll look at whatever those new prices are and they will strike a nav that nav is what everyone will transact at so that's the thing about funds and we'll get into trading flexibility you do not transact during the day you decide that you want to buy into a fund for a certain amount of money and then the price will get set after the market closes so that's what i'm talking about with all this fund administration that's around it fund accounting and everything else that is uh that is why you have that and that's how you transact you do not do that for etfs so there can potentially be a deviation from the nav um and we'll get to licks in a second the reason for that is just the way that etfs work so basically the way an etf works is that an etf as because it trades on an exchange just like equities just like licks supply and demand is going to change the price of the etf now there's a mechanism in place to try to keep an etf as close to that nav as possible as close to that net asset value as possible and basically what that is is is the fact that there are arbitrage opportunities for investment banks to exchange shares of etfs for the underlying basket of securities that are in them and so what they do is that mechanism allows the etf or generally has etf trading pretty close to the nav so let me give an example because this is confusing sometimes for people so let's say you have an etf for simplicity's sake that holds 10 shares so you have 10 shares you add up those 10 different companies you add up those 10 different companies the shares that are held in there and the etf is a hundred dollars so the net asset value that etf is 100 so let's say the price because of supply and demand moves away from that and i'll put a big price change in there just so it's obvious what happens so all of a sudden the etf is trading for a hundred and ten dollars when the shares are only a hundred dollars so this arbitrage opportunity and arbitrage is a riskless profit so what that means is an investment bank will go out and buy those 10 shares and they will trade it for the etf they go to the etf company the management company they'll trade those 10 shares they'll give them a share of etf and the investment bank automatically sells it so in that case minus transaction costs they make 10 doing that now the spreads are never that big but because of obviously computerized trading and the fact that they can all do this very cheaply that is what keeps the spread very very close so as you see deviations on either side an investment bank trading deaths will go out there and transact same thing on the other side what they'll do is they'll go out and they will take an etf share they'll buy an etf share they'll exchange it to the etf company for those 10 underlying companies in it and they'll sell them immediately that's what happens if it falls on the other side so that's how evaluation method works on an etf and we'll get into the implications of that in a second licks are totally totally different so they do not have this mechanism in place so there can be a very large discount or premium so this net asset value um so that's the difference in links trading flexibility we've been through this so anything on exchange you can trade anytime the exchange is open funds you can't so funds you got to wait once a day you can transact whether you're buying or selling so that's funds minimum investments another big one um so in theory there's no minimum investment for an etf now you're probably not the smartest person in the world if you're going out there and buying a 20 etf for a 10 transaction fee so there should be a minimum investment at least in your head but it's not like funds so funds obviously can have in some cases very high minimum investments but the good thing about funds is that once you've met that minimum investment a lot of them will then let you transact continually month after month at a lot lower level behavioral risk so behavioral risk just talks about our propensity to do dumb things and with anything that's traded on exchange there's more likelihood that you will do something dumb because you can um i don't know the example i always use is you're on a diet but you fill your house with a bunch of stuff you shouldn't eat well the chances of you eating it are going to be a lot higher if it's in your house same thing with trading so that's my stupid analogy i'm getting laughed at you can come up with a better one if you would like all right so let's uh let's talk about some of the different implications around uh around this um well we have lots of questions already so i will get to those in one second as soon as i go through what the implications are okay so a couple uh a couple different things so one of the reasons so if we look at different um if we look at different markets or different types of assets that we want to trade in particularly around this valuation method the more liquid the market so the more the underlying securities trade so we think really liquid markets think of like the asx 200. the more liquid the market the better it actually is if you're an etf because you're going to have smaller deviations from the net asset value if a market's very illiquid if it is something like small cap developing market stocks if it's something like fixed interest this arbitrage method that the investment banks do is going to be a lot harder which means that they are going to wait for a larger deviation from the nav before they'll actually act and bring it back close to the nav again the price of etf so it's something to think about um when you're uh when you're looking at different markets and looking at what is better to um what is better to use what's a better instrument to use so let's get to a couple questions just because we had a lot on this slide and we'll get into some other stuff um okay rodney had a question that i hopefully just answered he says presumably for the larger index tracking passive etfs the market makers both keep them very close to nab and smaller spreads exactly so that's the other thing the spread that buy cell spread is the other thing that matters and in liquid liquid markets so if it is more liquid in terms of the etf now if people are less interested in the etf if there's less uh if there's less assets in that etf that can cause widening by cell spread so that's the other thing that you need to consider but right yeah you're right so the market makers will keep that spread a lot closer if the market is liquids or as you said large index tracking passive okay so lisa says does arbitrage opportunity result in etf showing less volatility than equities no they'll basically have the same volatility as whatever that underlying security that's in there is so remember that this arbitrage opportunity is only trying to keep the price of the etf and the net asset value tight close together but they can still bounce around a lot depending upon whatever those underlying assets are so it's going to stay close to it but if there's a lot of volatility in that underlying asset that's in it like if it's shares there's a lot of volatility then that etf will also have it um yeah so john's asking what happens the value of the etf fall lower than the nav so hopefully i answer that so basically they'll do the opposite thing so if the etf is lower than the nav then they'll go out there they will exchange that unit of etf for the underlying securities and immediately sell them and i know this all sounds very complicated because you know we just sit there and when we're trading you're punching stuff into your you know comsec account but obviously all this stuff is computerized so it's automatically doing this as uh as there's any sort of um deviation yeah so brett is asking this question how do etfs grow in size can they issue new shares as demand increases yeah so constantly what they're doing this whole process is arbitrage process they're called creation units um at the end of the day so creation unit is just the way that we create more shares and more etf shares is we are trading whatever baskets of whatever underlying securities they're tracking so yeah etfs just continually grow in size unlike a lick so the difference with a lick is it is a closed end fund they never increase the number of shares so that's why supply and demand can really cause giant differences between um the price and the net asset value so particularly times of market stress where a lot of people are selling licks then you can get really big discounts between the net asset value and uh um and the price that it's trading at and so in down markets a lot of people like buying licks because that spread that um that discount widens my computer to speak um in case anyone's interested all right minimum investments for etf and lakes are really same as direct stocks yep rodney you're correct um it's whatever yeah the trade size is and whatever you think um is worthwhile paying commission right so whatever you're depending on your broker whatever brokerage you're paying obviously if you buy very small uh very small amount um you're gonna have problems but yeah thank you rodney all right we're gonna move on which is exciting now when i say trading tips for etfs i don't really mean trading tips but uh but anyway people are amused at that okay so a couple quick tips on if you're trading etfs all right so first tip check the spread and the market depth so a couple things about trading etfs it's generally not great to do it right when the market opens or right before the market closes particularly if you are buying global products so non-australian you're buying an australian listed etf but you are buying an international share etf it's not great to buy them right around open and close basically because there's a lot of volatility then um so at the end of the day wait a little bit wait until the middle of the day because the spreads are always wider right when the asx opens and generally right before it closes and so think about that because you know people are out there looking at futures so if you're buying like u.s um a u.s underlying u.s assets in an etf once we get to the end of the asx day right people are starting to look at futures the next day opening up and so you could see lots of weird stuff happening so yeah buy buy during the middle of the day and generally you'll get a smaller buy sell spread um i can't get i can't get that in my head for some reason i've been here six and a half years by cell spread doesn't make any sense bid ask spread is what i want to say but uh but anyway nobody cares about that um all right so limit orders so we do recommend and this comes from our manager research team not me um so they actually know what they're talking about um we do recommend um using limit orders what a limit order basically says is that you are willing to transact at a certain price rather than a market order where you're just gonna get whatever your broker can go out there and fill um we think limit orders are a better way to go um the problem is that if you have a pretty illiquid market that you could get an order fill at all sorts of different prices that could be quite far apart so basically what they'll go out there and they'll partially fill those orders so you say i want to buy 100 shares of well i'm thinking of a liquid market now because i can't think of anything else vanguard australian shares um you want to buy 100 shares like they don't necessarily have to transact and they won't generally transact 100 shares at a time in a block they might fill 20 at one price 20 at another price so you could have issues around uh around um e-liquid etfs um just because they're not able to fill that whole order at once so that's uh that's another one but if it is very if it's a large etf it's very liquid then it probably doesn't matter and you can use uh and you can use just a market order um yeah take a long-term mindset this goes back to that behavioral risk piece that we talked about just because you can do something doesn't mean you should do something so don't uh yeah don't trade too much in etfs i know everyone likes them because you can trade a lot but we also know that trading's bad um and it generally leads to poor outcomes but uh yeah take that uh take that long term outlook and then finally um we don't think that you should use stop loss orders once again especially in a liquid market so all these warnings are kind of the same a liquid markets can be problems for etfs so look at the liquidity and that's that whole thing on the on the top the spread and the market depth so market depth is not going to be great if it's in a liquid market um so yeah we think uh we think that these basically these stop loss orders that's when you put in that hey you're going to uh you're going to sell something at a certain price is that sometimes these can be executed at times that aren't great for you as an investor um basically when a spread is really really wide um so yeah we think obviously for long-term investors this stuff is less relevant anyway all right um let's see let's go into we're going to go to the website which i don't think i've opened that's very disorganized today i have to go on this weird panel discussion tonight with the equity mates um i don't know if anyone's listening to the equity mates listen to our podcast instead of them um we're better but yeah i'm doing a panel discussion at a brewery tonight which i guess is exciting but we'll see what happens all right so we're going to talk a little bit about building a portfolio and we're going to talk about etf model portfolios but first and i'll i'll keep this very very brief so obviously any time that you were building a portfolio it starts with your goals and we have whole webinars on this um that uh you can go on our youtube channel and watch start with goals you calculate a required rate of return that's return you need to achieve your goals you move into asset allocation now what we have here and this is our website by the way what we have here is we have five different asset allocation models everything from conservative out to aggressive and that's what we are basing these etf model portfolios in now each one of these obviously depending upon what your goals are as an investor and how that aligns with your or what that required rate of return is and how that aligns with uh with asset allocation is for different time frames and different expected returns so you're obviously getting more aggressive in more growth assets if uh if you're an aggressive portfolio and then way back in our conservative portfolio you're very conservative so lots of defensive assets so for instance we go on here we have suggested asset allocations for all these different asset classes so what we're going to do today is we're going to walk through etfs and for each one of these buckets we're going to walk through what our analyst's favorite etfs are in those buckets we're not doing cash because cash is boring um but there's some data shares cash etf we like anyway that's my setup now it's going to get exciting you can just you can feel the excitement building in the room i'm in the room with will and shawnee and they're both on their laptops doing god knows what not paying attention to this instant messaging everyone else i mean will's trying to get over the trauma of the ferry losing its steering but you know all right
