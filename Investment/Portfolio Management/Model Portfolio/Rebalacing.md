Rebalancing is the process of adjusting the asset allocation of a portfolio to bring it back in line with the desired allocation. This is typically done in order to maintain the risk/return profile of the portfolio, or to ensure that it continues to meet the investment goals of the client. In model portfolio management, rebalancing is typically done on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually, in order to ensure that the portfolio remains well-diversified and aligned with the client's investment objectives.

Here are the steps involved in rebalancing a model portfolio:

1.  Review the investment objectives: The first step in rebalancing a model portfolio is to review the investment objectives of the client and ensure that the portfolio is still aligned with those objectives. This may involve discussing the client's investment goals, risk tolerance, and other factors that could affect the portfolio's asset allocation.
    
2.  Determine the target asset allocation: Based on the investment objectives of the client, the investment manager or financial advisor will determine the target asset allocation for the portfolio. This will involve deciding how much of the portfolio should be allocated to different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash.
    
3.  Compare the current asset allocation to the target asset allocation: The next step is to compare the current asset allocation of the portfolio to the target asset allocation. This will help to identify any deviations from the desired allocation, and will allow the investment manager or financial advisor to determine which assets need to be bought or sold in order to bring the portfolio back in line with the target allocation.
    
4.  Make the necessary trades: Based on the results of the comparison, the investment manager or financial advisor will make the necessary trades to bring the portfolio back in line with the target asset allocation. This may involve buying or selling different assets in the portfolio, or making changes to the child portfolios within the model portfolio.
    
5.  Monitor the portfolio: Once the portfolio has been rebalanced, it is important to monitor it closely to ensure that it continues to meet the investment objectives of the client. This may involve reviewing the portfolio on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually, and making additional rebalancing trades as needed to maintain the desired asset allocation.
