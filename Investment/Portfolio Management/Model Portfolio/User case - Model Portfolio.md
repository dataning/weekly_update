# Aussie equity

| Conservative | Moderate | Balanced | Growth | Aggressive |
| ------------ |:--------:|:--------:|:------:|:----------:|
|      5%      |   10%    |   17%    |  23%   |     30%    |

Five different portfolios go from conservative to aggressive - a greater percentage in Aussie equities you can see from 5% to 30%. There're four ETFs that are part of these model portfolios. 
- BetaShares FTSE RAFI Australia 200 ETF 
	- Morning star rating (Bronze)
	- Price: $14.61, 0.62%
	- Four factor method: 
		- The index that this is tracking is based on this four factor method by the US firm research affiliates. They're trying to find undervalued stocks so basically trying to find value stocks and they're using four different metrics. That's the four factor model. They're looking at book value, sales, cash flows, and dividends to form this index and then BetaShares has an ETF that follows that.
- iShares S&P/ASX Small Ordinaries ETF - iShare small cap product 
	- Small caps in Australia - the smallest companies
		- Expectedly, you get more volatility but over time at least until the last 10 years small caps outperformed large caps over a long time frames until the market became so screwy after uh after um the gfc all right
	- The index is taking the 300 largest companies in Australia the ASX 300 and eliminating the top hundred so you're getting those 200 underneath so that's the index you're getting. 
		- It's an ETF model portfolio and small caps are generally a space where we do like prefer actively managed products better than passively managed products because there's more opportunity in some of these less liquid and less paid attention to paid attention to markets
- SPDR S&P/AXS 200 ETF - State Street advisor product
	- this just tracks the ASX 200
	- Price: $65.94, 0.34%
		- we like it because it's cheap and well managed um so they do have very low fees they recently cut their fees again so that's our favorite S&P ASX 200 tracking ETF. 
- VanEck Vectors Australian Equal Wt ETF
	- Price: $31.95, 0.06%
		- Low cost
	- More diversified than a regular ASX 200
	- Equal Weight
		- Most indexes are market cap weighted so that means the largest companies make up more of the index
		- a lot of concentration so in Australia in banks and resource companies so you're actually buying  into those particular industries instead an equal weight index says there's 200 stocks
		- Equal weight gives you more diversification across sectors so that balances things out different markets are of course different
		- A US equal weighted would give you less tech exposure for example um so then you actually like an eco-weighted S&P 500 same thing you get all 500

# Global equity

| Conservative | Moderate | Balanced | Growth | Aggressive |
| ------------ |:--------:|:--------:|:------:|:----------:|

	- Rating: Silver
	- Asset allocation
		- Cash (pit against the market)
- VanEck Vectors MSCI Wid ex Aus Qlty ETF
	- Quality Tracking - To find high quality global companies at an attractive price now this is an index right but the index is constituted to try to find these so um basically the end of the day they are looking at a couple different things they're looking at return on equity earnings growth stability and low balance sheet leverage to put in this etf
	- have big balance sheets
- Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets Shrs ETF
	- at the end of the day what you're looking for is more growth than you would get in a developed market although you realize that there's gonna be a lot more volatility and that there's more socioeconomic and political risks
	- if you're interested in emerging markets we think this is a cheap cost effective way to access them this vanguard product
- Vanguard MSCI Intl (HDg) ETF
	- anguard um just following a broad international uh index the hedge means that currency risk is removed from it
	- it's hedged


# Aussie Listed property

that's what we have here um a opportunity to yeah get exposure to uh to global markets without currency risk so we've talked before on these things about hedge products but you can see there are a lot of uh there are a lot of hedge products don't worry we're going to uh we're going to get through the rest of this fast listed property so real estate investment trusts at the end of the day all right so we've got a uh we've got another vanguard product on here if you're sensing a theme um now the australian listed property um sector is very very small so there are 47 companies listed in australia that are fallen to listed property real estate investment trust um bucket so we feel that because it's so small an index product is the way to go um it is difficult when you have such a narrow narrow group of companies in there it is difficult for managers to outperform that so we think this is a good place to be passive international listed property so um a lot larger so basically the target benchmark for this is 250 companies in it um so same thing we're looking at real estate investment trusts um different uh different companies obviously issued it but uh but that is our pick there so like now i'm just moving through this thing all right 


we're back to our friends at magellan so global infrastructure so global infrastructure the end of the day and this is another actively managed product you can see it's hedged so currency hedge that's what that means there um so basically what infrastructure is and what the definition is is you need an asset that is essential for the efficient functioning of society and have profits that aren't overly affected by competition commodity prices or sovereign risks so for a lot of infrastructure you'll see like sydney airport i know that they're going to build an airport god knows where that somebody will go to but sydney airport's the only airport in sydney um is that insulting okay well i don't know where it is well i know that but i don't know where that is anyway a lot of a lot of infrastructure do have monopolies like that so whether it's a port whether it's an airport whether it is something like trans urban that has monopolies on a lot of toll roads in different places at least for long periods of time that's what we're looking for infrastructure and now we get to the exciting stuff bonds everyone loves bonds um 

hey the australian bond market so basically we're looking at um we're looking at government bonds here um it's pretty uh pretty narrow market for government bonds so we've got an ishares passive etf and then finally why does my computer keep beeping finally we've got uh we've got global fixed interest so once again this is hedged removing that currency exposure and that is looking at government bonds globally um issued by investment grade companies uh countries countries um so countries that uh that at least the bond rating agencies believe have a a good chance of paying you back all right get it everyone's excited maybe just i'm excited okay uh let's start getting into some questions so if you have more questions ask them all right 

so you've got a question from vedanya if one wants to cash out would it not be better to be in a fund rather than an etf because the fund issuing companies bound to give you back your money within a set time limit while an etf you may not find buyers at the price you want to sell um yeah so i guess we're going to address a couple different points here um yeah i mean the advantages obviously was the fund as you said if you want to cash out for a fund you don't have to pay a transaction fee so that's one advantage now it's going to take them a couple days to give you your money so just remember that it does take a while to get your money back um but yeah at etf you may not find buyers at the price you want to sell so um so that is an issue i think with most etfs there's obviously enough liquidity that i think you can sell out even if uh even if it's a price that that you don't want to sell like all of us want to sell everything for more um but uh but yeah no it's a it's a good point about funds all right um 

so we've got a question from simone um this is where this i feel like they change zoom now all sorts of stuff is popping up which just confuses me um so in light of recent market commentary i'm interested in value based etfs vanguards value etf tran tracks banks coal based resources weapons tobacco liquor gambling it is extremely unattractive um esg based etfs appear to be growth based um tracking companies with high p e is the trend away from value really actually a trend towards esg all right so that's a really good question so there's a couple different things we can talk about here so number one let's uh let's talk about value versus growth so at the end of the day value versus growth is that we are just taking um can be a number of different metrics so whether that's book value whether it's price to earnings we start dividend yield price to cash flow all sorts of different metrics and we're just ranking companies and so depending upon what the index is if we have a growth or value index um they're just going to take a portion of the companies that have the highest one of whatever these metrics are and put them in the growth portfolio and then the cheapest ones are going to go into a value portfolio in general what the market used to do before as i described it so eloquently is screwy since uh 2008 what the market used to do is you'd see rotations so sometimes a different stock or industry would do well and then you'd have value stocks and you go buy the value stocks and the value stocks would do well and the gross stocks would become value stocks so you're you're in no way set um in where uh in where you are and so used to see more of a rotation we haven't seen a rotation since the gfc it's been all growth so just growth stocks did well now generally because we are looking at multiples that investors will pay different industries have different multiples because different industries have different characteristics so the things that have been valued highly by investors and some of this makes sense are a lot of technology companies for example because they have um they've had good growth prospects because they're very asset light right so they generate a bunch of cash that doesn't need to be invested back in the business they're very scalable um so at the end of the day you can get a lot more revenue and a lot more customers without hiring a lot of employees you have to build some factory um so they've been trading in higher multiples many of those companies as you pointed out are also companies that get good esg scores for all the same reasons right it's a lot easier to get a good esg store when you have 10 people sitting in a basement on a computer then if you have to dig up half of wa to pull something out of the ground um so you're going to get better esg scores so i would say that none of this is planned um but it's just sort of the reality that investors are willing to pay more for companies that have smaller footprints that translates well into esg we haven't seen any sort of rotation um so yeah i mean i think that that's uh i think that's probably the issue that you're running into um so if you don't want coal weapons tobacco liquor gambling that's like a night out with will minus the coal um but uh but yeah everything else is uh everything else was included do you like how i didn't include you in that yeah guess your mother's watching 


oh lisa says hope equity mates goes well they are some great guests so you're in good company number one lisa i can't believe you're listening to the equity mates um it's just yeah so it's a weird way to find out that you're cheating on shauni and i um and invest in compass but uh yeah i hope it goes well too i think they've had great guests until tonight um but uh yeah we'll see what happens um okay so joshua has a question would you uh would you not be looking at more quality etfs during uncertain times yeah i mean i guess a couple comments i'd say about this is unfortunately i think we're always in uncertain times uh people just forget about them and they look back and they're like oh stuff was a lot better back then but we were worried about something else back then but um but yeah no i think personally um i think the market's very overvalued um so i would say quality i do think is uh is something that uh that's important we had a lot of quality tilted indexes there so yeah i mean i think that i think that our manager research seemed that selecting these is acknowledging that perhaps that is a this is a good opportunity to focus on quality rather than all the speculative stuff that your friends uncles cousin just got rich off of um so uh so yeah i think that's a good comment um okay so we have a question from our favorite attendee the anonymous attendee saying i'm a bit confused i confuse everyone about what you're saying in relation to bond index funds you're saying that the aussie government bond fund is so stable that's okay to use as an in-depth fund okay so what what i was saying is that the market is very narrow um so let's talk about i didn't spend a lot of time on this let's talk about sort of active versus passive so that's that's what i was saying in terms of an index fund so when is it better to use active generally it's better to use active in fixed interest and we'll get into why in a second just australia is a little different um you want to use um you want to use passive funds generally right if you go back and look at where all this comes from is we do a report here at morningstar called the active passive barometer report where we look at different asset classes and we just go back 10 years and we say what's the percentage of active managers that outperform their benchmark and so what this tells us is number one in more efficient markets it is harder to outperform your benchmark so an efficient market is a market that well it's kind of a backwards thing an efficient market is a market where we think that there is less difference between what something is worth and what something is trading for so this is underlying stocks for example and the reason markets are efficient often is because there's a lot of attention on them so larger markets think asx 200 s p 500 it's a lot harder for managers active managers to beat those markets because everyone in the world's concentrated on them because they're large everyone in the world can invest in them there's all these analysts trying to figure out what something is worth so you don't see those large deviations generally between price and value in less efficient markets small caps we talked about fixed interest um there is uh there is more of an opportunity history shows us there's more of an opportunity for active managers to outperform and beat their benchmark the other thing is the size of the market so the investable universe relative to the benchmark is also really important and the reason for that is is that managers that have a giant so like if i'm in s p 500 um that's my index that i'm trying to beat there's 500 stocks right so i can go out there and pick whatever i want but still the index is pretty representative especially because of the way these market weighted indexes are but if you're out there in global fixed interest and there are thousands and thousands of different bonds the index is pretty narrow compared to that giant investable universe that could be in my mandate as a manager so the bigger it is the more of an opportunity i have to outperform so what i was saying about the aussie government bond fund is that unlike most fixed interest markets that are enormous the australian one isn't that big so there's not many bonds to go out and pick for pick from so that's just the point i was making all right 

![[Screenshot 2022-12-18 at 20.11.43.png]]
we've got a question from paulie saying do etfs have pe ratios well they do i'll show you i mean they don't and they do does that make any sense did you get that um obviously what you can do with an etf is you can look at the underlying um you can look at the underlying securities in that and just roll that up and that is that's the etf so i'm gonna go into where are we gonna go we changed the website now i can't find anything we want to look at etfs all right let's go into [Music] uh well that's no fun we'll go into active so this is metalist our top ratings active global equity we'll go into this magellan global active etf so if i go into portfolio here you go so basically what we've done here is we've rolled up all the securities that are in this etf and we've looked at the price earnings ratio as well as a number of other ratios and then you can trade it compared to the category average so the category that the ctf is in so probably global yeah global equity equity world large blend there we go we look at the index so this is msci world x australia index so you can compare it to the index category average etc so yes all right rodney what should happen is rodney should just come in here and do these things it would make my life easier um so rodney says there are at least five asx listed value etfs um across a couple different providers uh most are uh most are global so v l u v g m f e m k this is like an i test um k t a u m f w d m f so that was a lot of letters that i just i just rattled off at you but thank you rodney um once again if you're ever available between 1 and 2 p.m tuesday thursday you can come in here and do these um all right so we've got a question we've got a warren buffett question uh warren buffett said buy reits instead of real estate should we follow his move um always follow warren's move um yeah so let's let's talk about let's talk about reits versus real estate this will this will allow me to go into my real estate diatribe which everybody loves um yeah there are a couple problems with buying real estate and namely with the problem with buying um individual real estate now i own some individual real estate not that i live in i guess i'm a rent investor or whatever it's called but it's in the u.s and i'm not allowed to go back there but uh mom if you're on here sorry but um yeah so the problem sometimes with real estate is obviously you can't diversify as easily because properties are very expensive so at least the advantage that you get with reits is the ability to diversify and i guess people don't really think about this what are you concentrating in if you go out and buy an investment property well you're concentrating whatever place you bought it um so that could be very dependent upon the local economy i know like me saying this in australia where housing prices only go one direction sounds stupid but you're also very dependent upon that property as well so even think about neighborhoods and changing preferences and things like that and also you could buy a lemon of a house that continues to break and you have to pour more money in um there's all sorts of issues so i think that's probably warren's point um not that i should be trying to interpret what he says since he's obviously much smarter than me um but uh but yeah that's probably his point that at least with real estate investment trusts you do have the opportunity to diversify um so mim is asking is gold included in any of these portfolios i feel like mim has not been on forever um welcome back um is gold including any of these portfolios no it's not so we're not wild about gold here at morningstar um but uh but yeah hey not my call all right 


## what is the advantage of an ETF over a managed fund 
- easier to buy an ETF. If you are buying a single ETF, if you're investing a certain amount of money if you're gonna invest ten thousand dollars and you're going to keep it in something for ten years you get lower fees with an ETF. 
- The problem for ETF are better suited for sort of buy and hold than funds where if you're continually investing more money in them a fund is probably a better choice but you know you are getting lower fees so the management fees are generally lower
- you do have more flexibility now that can be a good thing as long as you don't overuse it 

so dennis is saying sorry i'm in a listed managed fund uh so listed managed fund so i think you're probably talking about um there are funds now m funds a trade on the asx um so yeah i mean you're basically faced with some of the same stuff with an etf right that there's a transaction cost that it's on a uh that's on an exchange but yeah i mean i don't think there are any real structural differences i would just look at fee levels um yeah 

so rodney's saying rodney soon to be co-host um saying quite a lot of traditional managed funds are now also dual listed so they're available as an etf also on exchange yeah so that's that magellan example i use for example so because etfs are so popular um and i of course attributed this to marketing but uh but people really like etfs so what are fund companies doing well they're just replicating the same thing as an etf um which i think is great so just look at the different fee levels that uh that you're paying 

so now we have the people that ask questions and chat we'll go over here so richard says magellan finally started to perform in recent months um we can ask shawnee if hamish said anything to her before the conference to indicate this um but uh but yeah um all right so it's a really good question by juan so juan is saying is it better to have more than one etf first per segment um say two for australian equity so yeah what i would say is make sure they are doing different things um so a lot of people think that like diversification is all by four different asx 200 etfs well don't do that um so that's not a good idea because you're just having four times as many transaction charges and they're all the same at the end of the day now we obviously think some are better and in that case just looking at fees and looking at their ability to uh to manage those fees but um but yeah i would uh i would i would just make sure that if you do want to invest in different etfs per segment as we went through remember each one of those ones i went through like in aussie equities they were all doing very different things there was a small cap one there was a quality one like they're all doing different things even though they were tracking indexes the indexes were always different um so that's what i would make sure one do etfs fail slash close and if so what happens to the shares um i assume you're talking about the etf shares now hopefully etfs do not fail um so i don't think they're gonna fail but uh but yeah if they close you i assume just get your money back um well you're gonna get your money back i don't know the exact mechanism but uh but yeah all right so good question from juan um with rising interest rates would it be better to buy actively managed fixed income funds okay so let's talk about that maybe so what happens when interest rates go up bond prices go down so a good trick is go on and look at the duration of anything that you are um invested in on the fixed interest side so basically duration and generally measured in years measures the impact of interest rates now this is looking historically so things could change but generally they're right looking at the expected change in the in this case etf um price based on a change in interest rate so if you see a duration of six for example that means if interest rates go up by one percent and remember bonds always move inversely with uh to interest rates if if uh interest rates go up by one percent the etf should go down by six percent now obviously it's not gonna be exactly six but it's showing you the duration so a higher duration means it's more interest rate sensitive so in rising interest rates bond prices go down so you would want lower duration now an actively managed etf would have the manager would have the ability to manage duration more in that portfolio rather than just following the index so the question would be does he actively manage does the active manager the manager just he or she know the right direction or can they predict the right direction of interest rates if they can then yes it would be better if they can't then no it would be worse um so it's really once again up to the skill of the manager but the manager can decide and make bets on not only the direction of interest rates they can make bets on the yield the shape of the yield curve they have a lot more leeway to position themselves now they have to position themselves correctly for what's going to happen but if they can if they can get that right then yes it's the same thing it's the same thing that you could say for an active manager right so like if i buy a passive s p 500 fund and the market goes down well i know how much it's going to go down my fund's going or my fund or my etf's going to go down the same as the market if there's a smart enough manager that decides that he or she wants to go into cash um and a lot of cash before a market fall then yeah you're gonna do a lot better but they have to get that right um but it's a good uh a good question oh this is a good one a general question what are your thoughts on the newly established cryptocurrency etfs well i can't say too much about etfs or will or about crypto or will will get very upset um yeah so i mean i think uh i think what basically has happened is the canadian regulators approved the first etf um [Music] first crypto etf so all these people have been applying in the us to try to get one of these including the winklevoss twins um who i actually know i went to school with their sister but uh but yeah including the winklevoss twins are trying to open etf the sec in the u.s the regulatory body kept turning them down canada has finally done it and um and i shudder at these words but the world will probably follow canada and other people open them up following canada is a big mistake but uh and that's just american humor we make fun of the canadians when i say stuff in australia they're always shocked that i'm being so offensive about the canadians um yeah i mean i guess it's your it's your thought on crypto at the end of the day right so it's an efficient way for people to get into crypto so it could probably create a lot more demand um for one thing that's a little easier to get in there um it depends upon where you think about the price of crypto anything about that well that was balanced and even-handed uh oh germany okay now we're following the germans and the canadians there we go um all right so now that i've insulted most of the people in the world um why don't we finish up today so anybody if anybody has any questions please email me at mark.lamonica1 at morningstar.com i'll probably get back to you tomorrow because i have to go drink beer with the equity mates um and talk about liquor stocks but uh and start beef yeah so shawnee wants me to get in a rivalry like a podcast rivalry of them it's a little like west side story right but um anyway thank you
