# What is model portfolio? #model_portfolio

For the building blocks for a custom portfolio, we make to make decisions such as
- How much of the portfolio stock investments are to be here in the US or overseas 
- How much should be invested in the stocks of big companies versus small 
- How much of the portfolio is to be in developed economies in emerging markets 
- Does the portfolio invest in index funds or employ diverse active investment strategies such as value or growth investing 
- Should the portfolio own corporate or government bonds 
- How much credit risk should be taken 
- Is it better to buy short or long-term bonds 

Both the model portfolios and custom portfolios are made from the same ingredients the funds listed on the core menu. However, think of a model portfolio as ordering a Deliveroo instead of buying individual ingredients slicing dicing and preparing them yourself at home. You simply order your dinner off the app menu and let a restaurant and driver do all the leg work for you. 

In the case of the model portfolio, the restaurant is a professional investment advisor (asset manager) this recipe determines which of the core menu options go into the portfolio and in what quantities. all you have to do is choose from a menu which of several model portfolios is best for you 

Advantage of MPS
> One of the main benefits of model portfolios is diversification. Advisors can create model portfolios that hold many different types of investments and investing strategies. Model portfolios are also effective for hands-off investors that want to invest but don’t have time for investment research. Advisors also rebalance portfolios to their original asset allocation, a task some individual investors struggle with.

Each model differs primarily 
- by the percentage of their stock ownership usually ranging from 20 up to 100 percent the percentage of stock you have in any portfolio determines 
- how much investment risk you will be taking 
- how much potential return you should expect your decision about 
- investment risk is the most important investment decision you will make it is a decision you must make whether you build your own portfolio or opt for a model portfolio

Disadvantage of MPS
> Model portfolios can have their setbacks. The most important is that clients don’t have much control over the invested assets. Financial advisors or model portfolio managers make portfolio decisions. Another drawback is the management fees; the more decisions advisors make for their clients generally results in higher fees. And though experts create these portfolios, strong investment performance isn’t always guaranteed; even the best investors can find it difficult to beat the market.

Model portfolios are pre-determined investment portfolios that are created and managed by investment firms, financial advisors, or other financial professionals. These portfolios typically consist of a mix of different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, and are designed to meet specific investment objectives and risk tolerances. Model portfolios may be based on a variety of factors, including the investor's age, investment time horizon, and financial goals.

Model portfolios are often used as a guide for investors who want to create a diversified portfolio but do not have the time or expertise to create one on their own. They can also be used as a benchmark for investors to compare their own portfolios against.

There are many different types of model portfolios available, including those that are focused on long-term growth, income generation, risk management, or a combination of these objectives. Some model portfolios may be actively managed, meaning that the portfolio manager makes decisions about which investments to include in the portfolio based on their analysis of market conditions. Other model portfolios may be passively managed, following a predetermined investment strategy, such as tracking the performance of a specific index.
