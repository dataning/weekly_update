## Project
- Lack of QC in the current process because everyone is adding the new assets into a large csv
- Luc is expected to build app where PMs can add assets to portfolio analytics in Aladdin and this is done through the Aladdin ATP
- In terms of inventory view, PMs can access through Aladdin at the moment but again the QC process is not there. 

## MPS vs CorePM
- MPS is where they often talk about researching signal and looking for signals (Peter's ongoing involvement) - they don't use Turbo
- CorePM is where they want to apply the parent model portfolios to children portfolio' they use Turbo; Jango is built by Django

## Questions
- [ ] How PMs get to design/decide their factors (at the moment, it's a consensus decision)
