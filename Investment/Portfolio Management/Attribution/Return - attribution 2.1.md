# Decarb rate (return)

## Questions
- If I had invested $100 in a particular stock, what would my investment be worth after a year?
- Would I have been better off investing in another security?
- If I had invested twice as much, what would my profit have been?

## Definition
- Return is defined as the rate of increase r in the value of an investment. 
- Alternatively, return is the ratio of money gained or lost (whether realised or unrealised) on an investment, relative to the amount of money initially invested. 

	$$ r = \frac{\delta P}{P} $$
	- where P is the value of the investment at the outset, and dP its change in value. The advantages of expressing profit as a dimensionless quantity r, rather than as a P/L (profit and loss) in currency terms, are twofold
