A statement of the fund’s overall return will show the aggregate sum of the returns from each investment decision, decomposed by time or by market sector. What it will not show are the fund’s returns, decomposed by risk.

__The purpose of attribution is to disentangle this single return into the multiple returns generated by each risk__. In other words, attribution measures which of your investment decisions about the portfolio’s underlying risks worked, and which did not. This is critical business intelligence for anyone involved in selecting, managing or marketing investments.

## Dependency
There is little use in being able to decompose the return of a security or a portfolio if that return is wrong. Fortunately, accurate reporting of results can usually be assumed. The introduction of the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) has ensured comparability of portfolio returns between managers and against benchmarks.

## Attribution delivery

- how well the manager’s hedging strategies worked.
