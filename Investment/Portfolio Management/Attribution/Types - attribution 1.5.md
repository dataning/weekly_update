Attribution techniques fall neatly into two well-defined categories:
■ equity attribution;
■ fixed income attribution.

Each category has its own algorithms, literature and jargon. The conventional view is that equity attribution is mostly about the Brinson algorithm, while fixed income attribution is mostly about yield curves. While not strictly true, this is a useful distinction, and the book follows the same pattern.

## Equity attribution
Equity attribution is usually driven by asset allocation and stock selection decisions. Individual equity returns are driven by both corporate and macroeconomic factors. From the attribution analyst’s perspective, there is no direct relationship between these market factors and security prices, and various statistical tools, such as factor analysis, can be used to find the core drivers of return, if required. Such topics are outside the scope of this text.

## Fixed income attribution
The price and return of fixed income securities are driven by a combination of structural and market factors. Typically, these include:
■ the cash flows of the security, including any guaranteed payments to the owner, such as coupons and repayment of principal;
■ the risk-free yield curve;
■ credit curves, where appropriate;
■ the resulting yield of the security;
■ other minor effects such as roll-down, convexity and paydown;
■ security-specific factors, such as the creditworthiness and financial strength of the issuer.
In most cases the relationship between a security’s return and the change in its underlying curve(s) is well understood. The factors that drive perfor- mance can then be described as the sum of different movements in these curves, such as parallel shift, changes at a particular maturity and global movements in a credit curve.
Fixed income attribution decomposes the return of individual securities into return from each factor, and then recombines these returns over the portfolio so that their total contribution to return may be measured.
Fixed income portfolios can also generate excess return by varying their interest rate risks against benchmark at the sector or aggregate level. The effect this duration allocation decision has on the portfolio’s outperformance may then be measured. The topic is covered in detail in Chapter 14.
