Managed funds that hold assets such as cash, equities, investment trusts and derivatives are usually managed via stock selection and asset allocation decisions. 

## [[stock selection]] 
- it is to determine which securities to hold. 
- security level

## [[Investment/Portfolio Management/Asset Allocation]]
- it is to determine how much of each security to hold
- it is varying the relative weights of subsets of holdings between the portfolio and the benchmark.

## Risk exposures
- In addition, many funds also hold fixed income securities, which supply exposure to additional sources of market risk such as yield, interest rate risk, credit risk and inflation.
- Exposure to securities that are denominated in overseas currencies generates exchange rate risk, which may be hedged and controlled using securities such as forwards.

Almost every investment portfolio has exposure to multiple concurrent risks, which occurs when
- the securities that make up the portfolio are inherently exposed to multiple risks. For instance, a corporate bond generates simultaneous returns from yield, sovereign curve risk and credit risk; the manager deliberately uses multiple risks as part of an investment strategy.

It is up to the manager to decide to which risks they want to be exposed, and to implement suitable investment strategies that put these decisions into practice.

Just as importantly, the manager should be able to hedge their portfolio so that it is not exposed to other, unwanted risks. For instance, an equity manager may decide to take only stock selection decisions, and not to have any asset allocation exposures. In this case, the fundâ€™s asset allocation return should always be zero, and the attribution report will verify that this deci- sion was implemented successfully.

Asset allocation hedges are relatively easy to implement, as they sim- ply require that each portfolio sector weight is equal to the corresponding benchmark sector weight. Other types of hedge, such as immunisation of the portfolio against non-parallel yield curve shifts, can be much more dif- ficult to implement and may require considerable expertise and investment in risk-management tools.
