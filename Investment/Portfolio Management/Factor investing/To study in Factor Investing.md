# Asset Allocation vs. Factor investing

(Chapter 16, Asset allocation from theory to practice and beyond)

This is very interesting because this sounds similar how I think about asset allocation and carbon emission analytics. A lot of carbon emission are not actionable in relation to asset allocation. 

> Many investors think of a portfolio as a composition of factor exposures, yet the vehicles available for investment are financial securities or aggregations of them such as asset classes. Moreover, investment in a collection of securities that is designed to mimic factor behavior introduces mapping error, which increases portfolio risk. This chapter shows how to construct portfolios of asset classes that at the same time reflect an investor’s preferences for specific factor exposures. 
> 
> Investors typically construct portfolios from asset classes because asset classes are easy to observe and directly investable. Factors, by contrast, are not always readily observable, nor are they directly investable. Investors must identify combinations of assets that best track the behavior of factors. And because the mapping functions between assets and factors change through time, investors who choose to allocate to factors are exposed to an additional source of uncertainty beyond the uncertainty of the factor performance. 
> 
> Nevertheless, some investors prefer to allocate to factors because they believe asset classes are defined arbitrarily and do not capture the funda- mental determinants of performance as directly as factors do. Also, some factors carry risk premiums that are not available from asset classes.

A quantitative manager wants to expand his current strategy from US equities into international equity markets. His current strategy uses a price momentum factor. Based on Exhibit 13:

> A portfolio strategy that has become increasingly popular in recent years is factor investing. The main idea underlying a factor-based investment strategy is for the manager to form port- folios that emphasize certain characteristics of a collection of securities—such as firm size, rel- ative valuation, low return volatility, momentum, or company quality—that are believed to produce higher risk-adjusted returns than those in a traditional benchmark that is weighted by the market capitalization of the stocks in the index. The risk premia associated with these characteristic-oriented portfolios—or factors, as they are called—allow the investor to1earn superior returns with better diversification than holding a traditional passive index fund.
> 
> This idea is illustrated in Exhibit 11.11, which is based on the analysis of Blitz (2015). Recall from our discussion of multifactor models of risk and expected return in Chapter 7 that many of these factor-oriented portfolios (for example, firm size, relative value, momentum, company quality) also appear as risk factors in expanded versions of the CAPM. So, a factor-based approach to investing can be viewed as one that overweights or underweights the various sys- tematic risk exposures in the risk model in an attempt to outperform a conventional market portfolio benchmark over time. The adjustment of these systematic risk exposures as market conditions fluctuate is what makes factor investing an active portfolio strategy and is why it is sometimes called a smart beta approach to investing.

> In academic literature, momentum trading and factor investing are the two closely related concepts that have been incorporated into modern portfolio theory. Momentum as a concept in finance [5, 6] refers to the empirically observed tendency for rising asset prices to rise further, and falling prices to keep falling, so actually it means the sus- tainability of the trend. The strength in our terminology includes momentum of price trend, but it requires the price trend to be well supported by a resonance of fundamental value and growth, together with the price momentum. In a stock market, if a stock exhibits price momentum and it is also a constituent in a strong industrial sector of a strong economy, then it can be said there is a strength in this stock with better reliability and sustainability. The existence of momentum is considered a market anomaly, which finance theory struggles to explain [7].
> 
> To find the possible sources of the strength in the stock market, factor investing is a computable approach that involves targeting quantifiable fundamental, technical and strategic characteristics from the firm level through sectors to the market and economy level that attribute to or can explain differences in stock returns. An investing strategy of this type tends to tilting equity portfolios towards or away from specific factors in an attempt to generate long-term investment returns in excess of benchmarks. The theory of factor investing traces back to the Capital Asset Pricing Model which is a one-factor model, and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory which provides a general form for multi-factor models. Fama and French [8] developed a three-factor model, from where a plethora of multi-factor models have come out subsequently. A systematic study by Frazzini et al. [9] used a six-factor model to explain the long-term performance of Warren Buffett, which is decomposed into its components due to leverage, stocks in publicly traded equity, and wholly-owned companies. The six factors include the monthly returns of the standard size, value, and momentum factors, the Betting-Against-Beta factor, and the Quality-Minus-Junk factor.
