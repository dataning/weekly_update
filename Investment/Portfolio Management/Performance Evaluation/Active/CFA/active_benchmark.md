# Benchmark characteristics:
- The benchmark is representative of the assets from which the investor will select.
- Positions in the benchmark portfolio can actually be replicated at low cost.
- Benchmark weights are verifiable ex ante, and return data are timely ex post.

**MSCI All Country World Index** and **Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index**
> Examples of indexes that are used as benchmark portfolios include the MSCI All Country World Index and the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index, which represent the performance of global equities and global bonds, respectively.

# Benchmark weighting (market cap weighting)
> An available security market index is often used as the benchmark portfolio. The most common market indexes weight the individual assets by their market capitalization. Capitalization weighting has played a prominent role in the development of capital market theory because such indexes are generally self-rebalancing and can be simultaneously held by many investors. Float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted indexes represent an incremental improvement over non-float-adjusted indexes by accounting for the percentage of a security or asset that is not privately held and thus available to the general investing public.

# Benchmark weighting's zero sum game 
> One important consequence of using a float-adjusted capitalization-weighted market index as the benchmark is that when all relevant assets are included in the market, the value added from active management becomes a zero-sum game with respect to the market. Because the market portfolio represents the average performance across all investors that own securities before costs, active investors as a group cannot outperform the market (i.e., active management is a zero-sum game). For benchmarks that have a narrower definition than the total market, active management is not a zero-sum game because investors can select assets outside the benchmark.
