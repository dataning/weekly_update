> The ex ante Sharpe ratio (SR) compares the portfolio's expected excess return to the volatility of this excess return, measured by its standard deviation. 
> 
> Expected returns and volatilities are not observable, but can be estimated as follows from historical data. 
> 
> Unless the risk-free rate is volatile (as in emerging markets), the standard deviation of excess and raw returns will be similar.


$$
SR_{p}= \frac{R_{P}- R_{F}}{\sigma_p}
$$
- $R_P$ is the portfolio return
- $R_F$ is the risk-free rate
- $\sigma_p$ is the standard deviation of the portfolio return. In this context, the standard deviation of the portfolio return is often called either volatility or total risk.

In $ex\ ante$ context
> The Sharpe ratio can be used as a measure of expected return and risk, in which case the general formula in Equation 5 would have the expected portfolio return, E(RP), minus the risk-free rate in the numerator and a forecast of volatility in the denominator. As subjective forecasts, the expected return and standard deviation of return will likely vary among different investors.

In $ex\ post$ context
> The Sharpe ratio can also be used to measure the ex post or realized performance of a portfolio over some time period. In that case, when applied to multiple time periods, the numerator in Equation 5 is the difference between the average realized portfolio return, RP , and the average risk-free rate, RF , and the denominator in Equation 5 is the sample standard deviation. The convention for Sharpe ratios is to annualize both the portfolio average return and the portfolio risk. For example, if the past return data are measured monthly, the average monthly return can be multiplied by 12 and the monthly return volatility can be multiplied by the square root of 12. The logic for multiplying the standard deviation by the square root of 12 is that variance (i.e., standard deviation squared), under certain assumptions, increases proportionally with time.
