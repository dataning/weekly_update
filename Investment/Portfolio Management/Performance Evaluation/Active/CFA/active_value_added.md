#  Describe how value added by active management is measured

Value added is based on a relative comparison to the benchmark.
> The objective of active management is to add value in the investment process by doing better than a benchmark portfolio. Value added is a relative performance comparison to investing in the benchmark portfolio, often called passive investing. 
>  - If the investor outperforms the benchmark portfolio, value added is positive. 
>  - If the investor underperforms the benchmark portfolio, value added is negative.

The same logic we can do is to put the money into the bank if the performance/risk is not up to the right ballpark.
> In the latter case, the investor would have been better off during the measurement period by simply holding the benchmark portfolio, particularly net of fees and expenses.

# Measuring value added

> The value added or “active return” of an actively managed portfolio is typically cal- culated as the simple difference between the return on that portfolio and the return on the benchmark portfolio

$$ R_{Active} = R_{P} - R_{Benchmark}$$

> A risk-adjusted calculation of value added, which we will refer to as the managed portfolio’s alpha, incorporates some estimate of the managed portfolio’s risk relative to the benchmark, often captured by the portfolio’s beta, $α_{P}$ = $R_{P}$ − $β_{P}R_{B}$. Unfortunately, the term alpha in practice is often used to refer to active return as well, which implicitly assumes that the beta of the managed portfolio relative to the benchmark is 1.


> Whereas many applications of value added focus on individual securities as the assets, we first illustrate the concept with a simple numerical example of a composite portfolio that has just two assets—a stock portfolio and a bond portfolio. Suppose the benchmark is a 60/40 weighted composite portfolio of stocks and bonds. The investor believes that over the next year stocks will outperform bonds, so the investor holds a portfolio that is weighted 70% stocks and 30% bonds. The managed portfolio is said to be overweight stocks by 10 percentage points and underweight bonds by 10 percentage points—in other words, an active weight of −10 percentage points on bonds. Assume that ex post (i.e., “after the fact”), the return on the stock market turned out to be 14.0% and the return on the bond market turned out to be just 2.0%. In this case, the return on the managed portfolio is 0.70(14.0) + 0.30(2.0) = 10.4% and the return on the benchmark is 0.60(14.0) + 0.40(2.0) = 9.2%.
- active_pf
	- 70% stock (10% overweight)
	- 30% bond (-10% underweight)
- benchmark
	- 60% stock
	- 40% bond

By using a more breakdown manner to work out the value added, we could see more clearly which asset/behaviour is contributing more into the value. 
> From these final numbers, one could directly calculate the value added as 10.4 − 9.2 = 1.2%. But using Equation 3, a more informative calculation of value added showing the contributions from each segment is $RA = 0.10(14.0 − 9.2) − 0.10(2.0 − 9.2) = 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2%. This breakout suggests that a 0.5% return relative to the benchmark was generated by being overweight stocks, and a 0.7% return was generated simultaneously by being underweight bonds — for a total of 1.2%. Of course, the actual returns might have been different—with the stock market return being lower than the bond market return, resulting in negative value added in the managed portfolio. For example, if the stock market had a return of −14.0% instead of +14.0%, the portfolio return and benchmark return would have been −9.2% and −7.6%, respectively. Then the value added from this single overweight/underweight decision would have been RA = 0.10(−14.0) − 0.10(2.0) = −1.4% − 0.2% = −1.6%.
- First method
	$$Value\ acdded = \sum[(Managed\ weight - Benchmark\ weight) * Return] $$
	
- Second method
$$Value\ acdded = Overweighted\ * (Overweighted\ asset - Benchmark\ return) - Underweighted\ * (Underweighted\ asset  - Benchmark\ return) $$

```python

import pandas as pd

# Set up the data
data = {'Asset': ['Stocks', 'Bonds'],
        'Active Weight': [0.7, 0.3],
        'Benchmark Weight': [0.6, 0.4],
        'Return': [0.14, 0.02]}

# Create the dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate the return for the managed portfolio
df['Managed Return'] = df['Active Weight'] * df['Return']; df
df['Benchmark Return'] = df['Benchmark Weight'] * df['Return']; df

# Calculate the total return for the managed portfolio
managed_return = df['Managed Return'].sum(); managed_return
benchmark_return = df['Benchmark Return'].sum(); benchmark_return

# Print the results
print(f"Managed portfolio return: {managed_return:.1%}")
print(f"Benchmark return: {benchmark_return:.1%}")


```

 -7.6% * (16% - 17%)  - 9.0% * (14% - 25%) - 3.5% * (8% - 11%) - 15.8 * (24% - 9% )
 - Note that the “Other Countries” active weight is zero, so this asset does not contribute anything to the portfolio’s active return.
