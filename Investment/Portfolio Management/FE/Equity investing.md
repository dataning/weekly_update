Equity investing can also be further differentiated in terms of style (growth, value and momentum) and size (defined by market capitalisation: large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap and micro-cap).

Value investing can be broadly defined as a fundamental long-term approach that seeks to invest in undervalued companies. In practice, value investing is often defined as investing in stocks with certain characteristics, such as low priceâ€“earnings ratios and high dividend yields. Asset managers seek to exploit valuation anomalies.

Growth investors seek to identify companies with good prospects for sales and earnings growth. The key to successful growth investing is identifying companies with superior long-term prospects which are not already reflected in the share price.

Momentum investors focus on companies that have a combination of stronger-than-average earning and/or price momentum, in the expectation that this trend will continue.

Definitions will vary, particularly in domestic markets of different size, but typically companies with a market capitalisation greater than US$10 billion would be considered large- cap, between US$2 billion and US$10 billion medium-cap, between US$250 million and US$2 billion small-cap, and below US$250 million micro-cap. Smaller-capitalisation companies can often capture the early stages of new industries, are often less well researched and management may have a higher financial stake in the business. On the other hand, smaller- capitalisation companies can be more volatile and are typically less liquid and more expensive to trade, with variable standards of corporate governance and smaller, less experienced boards of directors.

The global equity market capitalisation by listed companies in 2018 was $74.7 trillion, of which 40.8% was US, 13.6% China and Hong Kong, 10.8% EU 27, 4.9% UK, 15.3% emerging markets and 14.6% other developed markets.4
