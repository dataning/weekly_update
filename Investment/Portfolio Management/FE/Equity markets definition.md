Countries may be categorised as developed (countries which are developed in terms of economy and industrialisation), emerging (emerging countries are typically coun- tries with low to middle per-capita income that have undertaken economic development and reform programmes and have begun to “emerge” as significant players in the global economy3) or frontier (frontier countries are low-income in the beginning stages of economic growth and/or difficult to invest in because of investment infrastructure or regulation).
