Capital market assumptions are estimates of future market conditions that are used to forecast financial outcomes and evaluate investment opportunities. They are an important consideration in financial planning and analysis, as they help to determine the expected returns, risks, and costs of various investments.

Capital market assumptions can include estimates of future interest rates, inflation, economic growth, and other macroeconomic variables. They can also include assumptions about market risk premiums, such as the equity risk premium and the credit risk premium, which represent the excess returns that investors expect to receive for taking on additional risk.

In financial modeling, capital market assumptions are used to project the future performance of investments and to compare the relative attractiveness of different investment opportunities. They are also used to determine the required rate of return for an investment, which is the minimum return that an investor expects to receive in order to justify the risk of the investment.

Capital market assumptions are not certainties, and actual market conditions may differ from the assumptions used in financial planning and analysis. As a result, it is important to regularly review and update capital market assumptions to ensure that they remain relevant and accurate.


# Steps

1.  Determine the time frame for the assumptions. This could be a short-term outlook (e.g. one year) or a long-term outlook (e.g. 20 years).
    
2.  Gather information about the current economic environment, including data on inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.
    
3.  Consider the impact of geopolitical events and trends on capital markets.
    
4.  Analyze historical data on capital market performance, including returns on stocks, bonds, and other investments.
    
5.  Consult with financial experts and advisers to get their perspectives on the capital markets.
    
6.  Make assumptions about future capital market performance based on the information gathered and analyzed. These assumptions should be reasonable and supported by data.
    
7.  Regularly review and update the capital market assumptions to ensure they remain relevant and accurate.

# Data

1.  Inflation: Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation and avoid deflation in order to keep the economy running smoothly.
    
2.  Interest rates: Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money, and they can have a significant impact on capital markets. Higher interest rates tend to lead to lower stock prices, as they make it more expensive for companies to borrow money and invest in their businesses.
    
3.  Economic growth: Economic growth refers to the increase in the value of goods and services produced in an economy. It is typically measured by the gross domestic product (GDP). Economic growth can affect capital markets by influencing the demand for goods and services, as well as the availability of credit and investment capital.
    
4.  Geopolitical events and trends: Political events and trends can have a significant impact on capital markets. For example, elections, wars, and natural disasters can all affect market performance.
    
5.  Historical data on capital market performance: Analyzing past performance of capital markets can help provide insight into future performance. This can include data on stock, bond, and other investment returns.
    
6.  Expert opinions: Consulting with financial experts and advisers can provide valuable insight and perspective on the capital markets. These experts may have access to data and information that is not readily available to the general public.
