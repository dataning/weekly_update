i am sandoval kelpers team member with the trust level portfolio management and implementation team allison and i are very excited to talk to you this afternoon about our capital market assumptions because trying to predict the future is one of the most interesting things you do as an investor and i know we are the last presentation at the end of a really informative day and tom and steve from wilshere did a great job earlier in the day to touch on many of the topics we will cover so certainly feel free to interrupt me or alison as we move through this we'd like this to be a robust discussion and i find it is generally more interesting when we have higher engagement from the audience with that if i can ask everyone to please turn to page two of the presentation thank you i will begin this afternoon's discussion by providing you with an overview of capital market assumptions i will define them explain how they are used and why they are important next i'll provide a review of how calpers has established capital market assumptions in the setting of our strategic asset allocations for the public employees retirement fund and the affiliate funds i'll then turn it over to allison lee to walk you through examples of our process and the many important assumptions used in these models finally allison will review our plans for future developments to enhance and address the limitations of our current models with that if you could please turn to page three thank you i will begin by defining capital market assumptions as beliefs about the future performance of acid segments that incorporate theories observations and our experience in order to create these capital market assumptions investors make many simplifying assumptions about investment behavior that in reality are much more complex because the real world is much more complex and is constantly changing it's important to always remember that forecasting capital market assumptions as i think ben has said many times is truly a mix of art and science as described by wilshere earlier there's three components to capital market assumptions shown here as expected returns volatility and correlation throughout this presentation we are using color coding scheme in the text the green color denotes the desired component of an investment such as the expected return as rational investors will always seek to obtain the highest possible return in contrast the red color donates the undesired component of an investment such as the riskiness or volatility around its expected return the interaction between the assets which is characterized by correlations between their respective returns is also shown in red as undesired this is because as wilshere mentioned earlier one of the key objectives of strategic asset allocation is to achieve diversification basically to reduce the overall risk in the portfolio by investing in assets that behave differently during different economic regimes this allows us to lose less during economic downturns smooth out the compound returns that we are able to earn and preserve wealth over the long run as albert einstein once famously stated compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world he understood that it's not just about how much money we make but how much we keep how hard it works for us and how many generations we keep it for thus the higher the correlation and the more a like our acid segments behave the less diversification benefit we can achieve and just like volatility higher correlation is undesired and is and should be shown in red turning to page four i show that a 10-year horizon is common for asset liability management purposes as described earlier by wilshire this allows the strategic asset allocation to serve as an appropriate roadmap over a market cycle this time frame matches the experience we have had in the united states since the 80s where we've had a major economic recession as defined by the national bureau of economic research approximately every 10 years more importantly this long-term horizon enables us to earn an illiquidity premium in the private asset classes invest in opportunities that take longer to realize and hold on to or add positions during market dislocations of course as the agency that manages pension and health benefits for california's public employees we have to deliver sustainable investors investments to our two million members for decades to come some pension funds have chosen to use a 20-year horizon as inputs into their strategic asset allocation process but this is less common let me pause for a moment because i've just run through those pages very quickly before we turn to page five if there's any questions uh no there are no questions so continue okay turning to page five i show you how we use capital market assumptions as critical inputs into the portfolio construction process again as described by wilshire earlier we construct portfolios based on mean variance optimization or mvo for short mvo assumes that investors are rational and that they consider expected risk expected return sorry as desired and the risk of achieving the risk of the investment achieving its expected return as undesired the optimal portfolio for any investor under mean variance optimization is based on a really simple idea basically it creates a trade-off between the desired and the undesired to gain more of the desired or the expected return we will be required to take on more of the undesired or expected risk it's not much different than decisions we make every day where we're trying to determine which solution will provide us the biggest bang for our buck mvo reduces a very complicated real world problem into a rather simple mathematical process this process makes simplifying assumptions that differ from reality so before we run the mvo we must incorporate investment constraints to address these limitations to the model for example mean variance optimization process assumes that any class asset segment is scalable from no inclusion to literally being the entire portfolio for deep and liquid asset classes such as global equities or fixed income these are very reasonable assumptions however for less liquid asset classes such as private assets or even high yield where a large allocation could have a negative market impact on the pricing a maximum constraint serves as a practical check on the market feasibility of the allocation another important reason to utilize constraints is that mvo assumes that all risks associated with a portfolio can be captured by the volatility of returns the reality is as wilshere walked through earlier calpers risks are multi-faceted and should consider an expanded array of attributes liquidity drawdown and income just to name a few that will allow us to preserve wealth and enhance the sustainability of the fund over the long term placing a minimum constraint on bonds is one way to ensure that the portfolio has enough liquidity and protection against drawdown risk once we define cmas and the investment constraints we can use the mvo to find the set of portfolios with the highest return for any given level of risk now this vastly simplifies the portfolio selection problem because investors need to only consider the portfolios on the efficient frontier rather than the entire universe of possible portfolios mvo also quantifies the notion that diversification reduces risk i'll show you exactly how this is done in a couple of slides if you could turn to page six thank you i'm going to show you how we put this theory to a test with a simple two asset bond and stock example recall that we first start with theory observations and experience to derive capital market assumptions for each asset segment and that there's three pieces of information we need to do this expected return volatility and correlation now let's say the cmas for stocks and bonds are accurately shown in this table with stocks earning more than double the return and risk than bonds and bonds being slightly negatively correlated to equities the next question we must address is what is the right mix of stocks and bonds for a portfolio this is where we use mvo to guide us to an answer on page 7 i show a graphical presentation of all possible asset mixes of this stock bond portfolio the x-axis represents the expected portfolio risk again that's the undesired and the y-axis represents the expected portfolio return the desired we will start with the scenario of 82 bonds and 18 stocks and then with the scenario of hundred percent stocks and no bonds we also plot the portfolio expected return and risk for all possible portfolios in between these two portfolios i also listed in there in the middle of the 60 40 portfolio since many investors view this as a passive portfolio the portfolio is considered to be efficient or a portfolio is considered to be efficient if no other portfolio offers a higher expected return with the same level of risk or if no other portfolio offers lower risk with the same or higher return the efficient frontier represents a set of all portfolios with the highest return for each level of risk or the lowest risk for each level of return that's shown here as the blue line as shown in the previous slide stocks are riskier than bonds exemplified by its higher volatility than bonds as we allocate more to stocks risk goes up at the same time portfolio expected return goes up since we are assuming more risk in addition and in accordance with our investment belief we should be compensated for more risk in the form of higher expected return thus we should expect an upward sloping curve for the efficient frontier and that's exactly what we see on this page on page 8 i demonstrate that the efficient frontier can change as factors such as correlation between the assets change recall that in mvo expected return is desired and expected volatility is undesired thus ideally we would like the efficient frontier to go up along the y-axis and go to the left along the x-axis that is we would like the efficient frontier to go towards the upper left direction in the previous bond in stock example i assumed a correlation of negative 0.1 between stocks and bonds this blue line continues to represent the efficient frontier from that example as correlation goes up from negative 0.1 to 1 the efficient frontier goes to the less desirable direction or toward the lower right corner because we are getting less of the diversification benefits so every portfolio option is less efficient and requires more risk and lower return alternatively as correlation goes down the efficient frontier goes to the more desirable direction the upper left corner because we are getting more of the diversification benefits this confirms our belief that an mvo higher correlation just like risk is undesired it also illustrates the point i made earlier that mvo quantifies the notion that diversification reduces risk because at every point on the efficient frontier you can quantify how much additional risk you will have to take in order to earn additional return i'll pause here to see if there's any questions before i move on yes we do uh miss taylor okay hearing none yeah no we have one miss taylor so diane hello hi thanks for um doing this this is an uh very good i don't think i've had this explained before so the mvo um i thought earlier wiltshire's um their presentation they talked about constraints and constraints that they explained meant that our returns were probably going to be worse because of constraints implied it's made you're explaining it differently um showing us that it actually could help return could you ex kind of explain that for us yeah so let me let me be clear so i'm not saying anything different from what will sure said what i'm showing you is an example about how correlation impacts the uh efficient frontier adding constraints into this into this process should exactly as wiltshire described without the use of leverage push the efficient frontier down to the less desirable location and the reason for that is because constraints essentially don't allow you to get as much let's say of those high returning assets because you usually put a maximum constraint on the higher returning assets and you put a minimum constraint on the lower returning assets so it forces you to a less efficient place but the reason we have to use constraints is because otherwise you would get very impractical outcomes so you know you would get portfolios which would want to have a huge amount allocated to private assets and private equity in particular um and you would you might get portfolios with you know zero or or no um bonds uh so so that would be um that's what i was saying earlier is that you really need to adjust for a holistic view of what you define as risk because risk in this framework is just one-dimensional it's the volatility of returns and risk to calpers is multi-dimensional and therefore we we really do need to consider um liquidity drawdown income uh many other dimensions that are not considered into this framework besides that it's just from a feasibility even if we wanted to increase the allocation to private equity from let's say 8 to 16 that would be very very difficult to do without impacting uh pricing in that market high yield is another example where you know if we wanted to move our allocation from three percent to 20 um you're given the size of you know you know 400 billion assets that you are very likely to move the market and so it just wouldn't allow you to have that pricing discipline okay great thank you that helps explain it thanks you're welcome you're welcome okay continue all right so moving to page nine the previous example shows how mbo provides asset allocators a common analytical framework work whereby there's only one decision factor the investor's risk tolerance or how much risk an investor is willing to take that needs to be determined in order to select the portfolio weights as wilshere said earlier this is an incredibly powerful framework um developed in 1952 by harry markowitz uh who then won the the nobel prize um and it really shows us how mvo reduces a complex real world problem into a rather simple framework within which an investor's preference is clearly defined and fully quantifiable now as is true for the application of any theory to real life it is important to know the underlying assumptions of the theory and to assess how realistic these assumptions are our goal in identifying and understanding these shortcomings is to try to make appropriate adjustments or add additional lenses that allow us to have a more holistic approach to solving the problem and hopefully to build a much stronger portfolio earlier describing the need for using constraints i walked through the practical limitations of mvo um you know and and again really the the biggest limitation there is that volatility captures all the risk that calibers would care about would in fact we have an investment belief number nine that clearly states the contrary that our risks are multifaceted and include a broad range of investment in actuarial risk measures two other important assumptions worth mentioning are that asset returns are normally distributed and that mean returns volatility and correlations are constant and known now both of these assumptions are made because it because it is mathematically and statistically convenient the reality is that asset returns tend to have higher peaks and longer tails than a normal distribution would predict also acid returns are time varying and tend to behave very differently under different economic regimes and conditions as we've seen you know in in this last um crisis through drug covid so in order to counter balance these simplifying assumptions we establish constraints but we also rigorously stress test portfolios using monte carlo simulations and i think um scott talked about those simulations where we literally have you know over ten thousand simulations and we also stress test our potential candidate portfolios through economic scenarios to understand the ability of these portfolios to meet a set of investment and actuarial metrics given the risk tolerances defined by the board if i can ask you now to turn to page 10 thank you i will walk you through a broad overview of our process for setting cmas because we know that forecasting cmas involves quite a bit of art as well as a science and is dependent on us getting a lot of assumptions about the future right we build quite a bit of humility into our process so here i show you the three steps that we follow first we build our own internal cma models based on experience and coupled with cutting edge practices and techniques from leading practitioners in the industry second we add humility to the process by including cma survey results of several asset managers and consultants and really digging through to understand the drivers of significant differences being made in their assumptions versus our assumptions third we build consensus on asset segment cmas with team members from trust level portfolio management and implementation the research and strategy group asset class experts actuaries our cio our cocior and our board consultants to establish what we think the marketplace has to offer with that i will turn this presentation over to allison lee from our research and strategy group to walk through specific examples of how we forecast our capital market ex expectations over you allison thank you good afternoon members of the board and thank you diane for that very illuminating introduction to the definition of cma and the very important role they play in our strategic asset location and the asset liability management process i'll pick up from the beginning of our cma methodology which is our internal cma models please turn to the next slide please as a researcher this is the part that we are very excited about investing is about forecasting and cmas should incorporate everything we know about an asset class it's represented in a succinct way to focus on the essential elements so here let's see the expected return for the two major public asset costs equity and fixed incomes wilshire's presentation earlier this afternoon has touched upon their analysis of expected returns of equities the building blocks here are a deeper dive into their igb model on page 66 which is slide 17 of their presentation yield the same as income is the i growth in yields is the g and the valuation change is the v this expression goes back to the basics of the valuation of any financial asset warren buffet in berkshire hathaway's 1992 annual report wrote and then paraphrased in the theory of investment value written in 1938 john burr williams set forth the equation for value which we condense here the value of any stock bond or business is determined by the cash inflows and outflows discounted at an appropriate interest rate that can be expected to occur during the remaining life of the asset therefore i is the cash inflow today however we do not expect cash flow to remain constant within our forecast horizon thus g is how much the cash flow will grow within our forecast horizon growth comprises two elements inflation and real gdp growth two factors impacting equity returns the v block is the tricky part and the improvement upon the basic valuation theory to represent what happens beyond our forecast horizon for the remaining life of the asset turning to fixed income we just discussed that the basic valuation theory applies to any financial asset yet each asset class has its uniqueness in terms of contractual cash flows comparing to equities fixed income is less exposed to the growth factor because its cash flow is fixed thus growth is not a separate block however growth factor does affect future yield curve and future credit spread future yield curve is input to the yield block because here yield refers to average yield between now and the end of the forecast horizon and future yield curve and future credit spread are inputs to the valuation change block specific to fixed income low return with respect to a fixed rate fixed income portfolio captures the fact that the value of the portfolio will change because of the passage of time for example on an upward sloping yield curve with a passing of one year a 10 year duration portfolio becomes a nine year duration portfolio so it slides down the yield curve and lower yield brought about extra return in addition fixed income also solver suffers from credit loss investment grade mainly suffers from the loss from ratings downgrade while high yield high yield mainly suffers from default net recovery in summary this slide introduced our methodology for the two major public asset class and explain how our methodology is consistent with the valuation equation and incorporate the specific contractual cash flow of each asset class so since uh this is the basic fundamental valuation equation i'll just pause here to see if there's any questions yes i have a question on the fixed income uh line what's the role return the second last year what's that the real return is specific to fixed income it just captured the uniqueness of fixed income that the value of the portfolio actually changed because of the passing of time even though if you assume the yield curve remains the same okay so uh the yield curve is like generally it's upward sloping so your 10 year duration portfolio is here after one year it's nine year duration portfolio so it slides down and because of the lower yield it brings you a higher return because the price and yield are in the opposite direction for fixed income okay so it's really rolling down yes yes all right okay thank you uh any other questions no further questions so it's reasonable to expect that every estimate should adhere to the same fundamental valuation equation then why is there such dispersion in the estimates so let's move on to the next slide so here let's see the example of equities again current yield is public information thus everyone agrees more or less on block i however there are myriad inputs and methodologies in determining the g block some shops looks into past growth rate whether they are the average in the past 10 years or during a full business cycle some will uh some will adjust the numbers deemed outliers while others won't other shops rely heavily on analyst consensus forecast whether they are calculated based on consecutive earnings or the growth rate was forecast explicitly as a growth rate still there are others from their growth focus based on the analysis of future trends in technology and population thus it's quite natural that there is a large dispersion in the g block and the same applies to the v block so that's a brief introduction to the basic valuation equation for public assets equity and fixed income if there are no further question we'll move to the next slide for private asset class continue so there are several segments within private asset class such as buyout venture mezzanine debt and distress debt etc we usually leverage our knowledge and data from public markets total corresponding private markets this is consistent with our understanding that private markets are levered and illiquid public markets here are the building blocks of expected returns for buyout and venture which constitutes 90 percent of the private equity market buyout and venture private equity expected returns start with public equity expect returns firstly we adjust for beta because private equity companies usually have more sensitivity to systematic equity risk because of their size development stage industry or geographical location secondly we are just for financial leverage because private equity by our companies usually have a much larger and different debt structure from public equity companies to magnify their equity risk and return after paying for the higher debt servicing costs well venture companies usually do not have any debt thirdly we add a compensation for lack of access to invested capital firstly we add the value that general partners can generate through operating in the private market without the short determinism and formulating and executing a successful business strategy and finally we subtract fees paid to general partners in a typical private equity structure that include both base fee and performance fee so if there's not any question we can move on to the next slide for example of private real estate and no further questions here we present the building blocks of expected returns for private real estate as an example for real assets again we start from capitalization rate which is a real estate jargon that is equivalent to gross yield on investment similar to the i block for public equity oh sorry this is after this should be after the adjustment so firstly we subtract the capital expenditure needed to maintain the real estate asset to arrive at current net yield which is similar to the i-block for public equities so what follow are the g and b block for real estate we believe that growth in net operating income is more sensitive to future inflation than to future gdp growth and the valuation change is likely to result from the difference between the net capitalization rate and the nominal bond yield the analysis so far is based on property data without considering leverage next we adjust for the use of leverage which magnifies both risk and expectation finally we subtract the management fees because private real estate investment is deployed through managers so now let's move on to the next slide now let us move on from expected returns to expected volatility and correlations volatility estimates seem a little simpler because the same technique and statistical methodology can be applied to the historical data of all asset segments however we do adjust when we think changes in economic factors have significantly altered the behavior of a certain asset segment correlation obviously require estimation at the same time to ensure the full rank of the correlation matrix we start with the msci borrow one model but supersede our reviews based on macroeconomic analysis our next slide please so all the inputs into cma models such as inflation real gdp growth and their derivative measures such as nominal interest rate and the corporate earnings are represented by their mean estimates if they realize the value are far away from their mean manifesting as a microeconomic shock the realize that returns volatility and correlations will also fall far away from the cmas disrupting our strategic plans relying on those cmas sometimes microeconomic shocks are caused by geopolitical shocks such as the one we are in right now and finally we cannot list the things we don't know that we don't know or things that we thought we know but can change just when we become comfortable there's nothing we can do about uncertainty but there are things we can do about and knowledge so let's turn to the next slide for further development we are constantly on the lookout for new analysis new insights new models and new methodology as shown in previous slides inflation and real gdp growth are fundamental inputs into cmas of all asset segments it is very important to keep the internal consistency of our models by using the same inputs across all asset segments under such conditions any estimation error in inputs will affect all asset segments in the same way so their relative rankings are maintained further research in microeconomic area will improve upon our estimates of those fundamental inputs thus improve the accuracy of ocmas another area for improvements is in individual asset segments for example we gain deeper knowledge on the potential of operating improvement in private equity companies or on the cost of valuation change in real estate etc with that we are now open to questions okay i don't see [Music] any questions just a comment if you go back to um slide uh [Music] the one the shocks to the estimate slide couple back yes this one i would just suggest that the geopolitical shock from the pandemic is there now because it has occurred but i think it really belongs under unknown risk because it's truly it was a black swan where you couldn't hardly predict that uh uh uh of the you know that event so i mean it's there now because we know about it but unknown risks to me are things like the pandemic so just an observation okay yes okay this presentation was finished in the pandemic okay okay right okay i understand okay i see no further questions from uh any board member so is that the conclusion of the presentation yes okay well i would like to thank uh you for this presentation and actually thank everyone um all of the poundless and the staff that uh yeah how about it for the staff and the panelists who participated today and uh and also our public members and i don't see any requests for anyone from the public to speak so i assume there's no one but you know i think it's also important that we think the operational team because just think about this whole day what was required to get us to the stage you know uh the technology the communications the written materials so it's a lot of people i i know that are behind the scenes that make this happen so i just want to we should applaud those individuals too so thank you very much agreed okay so the board will meet again tomorrow morning starting at 9 00 am and feel free to join us then from the public and have a good afternoon every evening everyone
