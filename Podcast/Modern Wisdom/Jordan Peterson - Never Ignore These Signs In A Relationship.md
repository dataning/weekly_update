I found a thread on Reddit that was “five questions to ask yourself if you’re unsure about your relationship.” Questions like: if someone told you you’re a lot like your partner, would that be a compliment? Are you truly fulfilled or just less lonely? Are you able to be unapologetically yourself, or do you feel the need to show up differently to please your partner? Are you in love with who your partner is right now as a whole, or only with their good side, their potential, or the idea of them? Would you want your future or imagined child to date someone like your partner?

  

That thread was filled with people having existential crises. It seemed to me like a collection of people who’d decided that postponing the discomfort of deciding about their relationship was somehow noble or virtuous—even though they knew that if they deferred long enough, the issue would just be shoved under the rug.

In most relationships you can break up, or you can have a thousand fights and then make peace that way. You’re different from your partner, so there will be things to work out—but that’s not a compromise; it’s a solution. You each bring your skills to the table and figure out a game you both want to play, one that’s better than what you could do alone.

  

Getting to that point is very difficult. People bring all sorts of baggage, and you have to work through it much like disciplining children: you notice the problem, ask yourself questions, seek feedback, and then address it. If your partner is annoying you, you might ask, “Am I the tyrant here?” and get her perspective. If she agrees it’s you, you listen. If she says she’s annoyed too, you determine whether the problem is mutual or if it’s one-sided. That dialogue—thrust and counter-thrust—circles around the issue until you get to the root. Then you can sort it out.

  

Over time, sorting enough of these issues allows you to live in peace, which is worth attaining. In my marriage—and in my clinical practice—I recommend rules like this: if someone bugs you once, note it and do nothing. Twice, still do nothing. But the third time, address it directly: “Here’s what you did.” They’ll deny it, you’ll point to the other two instances, and then they’ll come up with reasons. Some reasons might reveal something about you, and that’s part of the process of unraveling the problem: deciding what you don’t want to do, and how you do want to treat each other.

  

What you aim for is a relationship where your everyday life resembles the best moments of your best dates—where you and your partner continuously sculpt each other into better versions of yourselves. That’s not compromise in the sense of defeat—it’s mutual improvement, akin to the Michelangelo effect, where you chip away each other’s rough edges to reveal the masterpiece within. When love is genuine, you see your partner’s hidden potential and encourage its emergence while discouraging what gets in its way. That collaborative sculpting is the essence of a thriving relationship.
