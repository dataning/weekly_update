What were you just teaching me about mouth breathing and how it changes the shape of the face?

1 (6s):
Yeah, so I arrived carrying a copy of the book Jaws A Hidden Epidemic. This is Not Jaws the Shark. This book was written by my colleagues at Stanford, Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich. And it has an introduction by Jared Diamond who won a Pulitzer for guns, drums, and steel. And a forward by the great Robert Polsky, also a colleague of mine at Stanford. So four heavy hitters on this book just to credential it. First, this book centers around a couple of core concepts, but the first being that people, and in particular children who overuse mouth breathing as opposed to nasal breathing have changes in the structure of the face that well, to be quite direct makes them far more unattractive than if they were to mouth breathe.

1 (56s):
It also discusses the chewing of foods as essential to mouth and face development. Sandra Kana is an expert in c craniofacial function and structure. And the fact that if your parents and you did things right, you should be able to place your en your entire tongue on the roof of your mouth with your mouth closed. Now I can't do that. Okay, so when you with teeth closed tongue on the roof of your mouth, I can, but I still feel the back of my teeth a bit. So I, yeah. Okay. But the, so that's the second point that we want to chew Heart chewing foods is essential to tooth and mouth and face development.

1 (1m 41s):
These days, many children slurp their food, many adults slurp their foods. Many adults are eating like babies and of course babies before they develop their mature teeth. And even when they, before they get all over their teeth in need to, obviously breast milk and, you know, putting like foods. Okay. But, so that's the second point. So, nasal Breathing, good mouth Breathing, bad for c, craniofacial development, chewing hard foods, chewing a lot on both sides of the mouth. Great for c, craniofacial development, oral development, tooth development, and tooth health, which by the way are correlated with a number of other things like cardiovascular health and metabolic health. Very, very interesting links there. And then the third point is that the, the book argues that the entire field of orthodontia things like braces, things like headgear, things like retainers are the byproduct of poor breathing and let's just say overconsumption of soft foods in place of hard foods behavior.

1 (2m 43s):
And so there's this guy who's from your side of the pond, mu I like him already, the mu method of restoring normal c craniofacial development. The book is chockablock full of impressive photos of before and afters. Impressive. Because in some cases you'll see kids that were mouth breathers or were eating a lot of soft foods, and then they recovered their behavior, so to speak, and became nose breathers. Of course, we have to mouth breathe when we're exercising really hard. Mm. Or when we're eating or speaking, we're gonna mouth breathe, but at rest we should nasal breathe is the argument. And that greatly Improves c craniofacial aesthetics. And the good news is this stuff is modifiable across the lifespan.

1 (3m 26s):
And, and so the book isn't arguing for anyone to purchase anything. You don't need a jaws or sizer. I'm saying that explicitly because they took clips of me talking about this and, and, and productized it. And I had nothing to do with that. So hopefully you'll keep this in the episode. And, they even admitted they were breaking the law and he said, we don't care. We're gonna continue to do it. So sales

0 (3m 43s):
Are salesman.

1 (3m 44s):
Yeah. But now those, those, you know, to, to the credit of, of products for exercising the jaw. Sure there are muscles of the jaw that can Well, what you're talking

0 (3m 52s):
About,

1 (3m 53s):
The aesthetic, but using food

0 (3m 55s):
To do that. Yeah. Eat tough food is if you don't have a sufficiently tough diet Yeah. I guess you could replace it, but it's, explain to me the mechanics of how the difference in whether you breathe through your nose or breathe through your mouth changes the shape of your face and head.

1 (4m 10s):
Yeah. Well, and it goes beyond that. If you breathe through your mouth as opposed to your nose, the first of all, you bring in less oxygen than you would if, so you're, you're limiting, you're effectively putting yourself into a state of apnea. Right. Which is bad during sleep. And guess what? It's bad During waking states also, you get less oxygen to your brain. Bad the sinuses, you know, we hear are my sinuses are clogged or my sin the sinuses wish I had brought a skull with, with me. 'cause one of the most impressive things about a skull, human skull being no exception, is that the sinuses are literally these little tubes or channels through which fluid and air can move. And the sinuses, even though essentially the created by the fissures between different bones, so like there, there two, two or three different bones that are interdigitated and create these tunnels, they're actually fairly plastic in the sense that they can be modified in terms of their shape.

1 (5m 3s):
And, and so people will say, well, I have a deviated septum. Guess what? You should try and emphasize Breathing through both nostrils as a, in order to un deviate your septum. Now, if someone has a broken nose or something that's really structurally abnormal, they may need a corrective surgery, but purely through na deliberate nasal breathing. So it could be mouth taping at night, but also just deliberately nasal breathing during most of your cardiovascular training, unless you need to really, you know, hit the gas, in which case mouth breathe is going to help dilate the sinuses and lead to better airflow, which makes nasal Breathing easier. The other thing is that nasal Breathing we know, well, first of all, there's a nasal microbiome. There's also an oral microbiome, but the nasal microbiome is particularly well-suited to scrub or capture and destroy viruses, bacteria, and even some fungal infections.

1 (5m 51s):
So in other words, when you're breathing in through your mouth, you're more susceptible to infections. This is important heading into winter as well. Hmm. So there are a number of, I mean, we could talk about this for hours, but the point is nasal breathe when you can, kids especially, but adults as well, chewing foods that require, you know, eating foods that require some chewing and really working at it and chewing away. They have some impressive images in this book of kids that were twins that were raised separately, one by a group that eats a lot of, let's just say tougher foods that require chewing versus one that's slurping their food. And I mean, one kid is literally incredibly attractive, perfect ture with no orthodontia, orden or, you know, regular dentistry. And the other kid is teeth is like snaggle. Wow. They have the horse what, like the horse he smile

0 (6m 32s):
Even though they've got the same genetic predisposition.

1 (6m 34s):
Right, right. It's not a perfect experiment because there are other factors as well. And you know, none of this is the, for better or worse, none of this is really amenable to kind of in laboratory type stuff. So as these are naturally occurring experiments, as we say, there are also some very impressive images in the book. Or we could say depressing of kids that were pretty attractive as kids. And then there, there's an example of a kid who got a pet hamster. He was allergic to the hamster, he switched as a consequence, he becomes a mouth breather. And then the, the characteristic change in the face when one over does mouth breathing is that the chin character moves back

0 (7m 9s):
Recesses, yeah. Toward

1 (7m 10s):
The, toward the neck. And the, the rest of the face goes out. But also the eyes become droopy. And the, but as you say, why would the eyes be affected? It's not just musculature. What's happening is there's less use of literally the, the sinuses in the upper, the towards the upper mandible and up towards the eyes because there's, you ever had a sinus infection, it's painful up here in your forehead and around the eyes. So again, it's pretty straightforward, no products required. Chew, chew your food. Well chew on both sides of your mouth, especially if you're a young person. But even if you're not be a nasal breather, really chew it. Your food try and probably also has benefits in terms of limiting ential or low, low nutrient density calories, you know, slurping your food all the time.

1 (7m 54s):
I mean, I love a good Greek,

0 (7m 55s):
Don't drink your calories, man.

1 (7m 56s):
Yeah, I love a good Greek yogurt, you know, but, but drinking an excess of calories is probably not good. And, and eat like an adult. I always say, you know, One of the things I don don't know. Like to me growing up snack food was something that kids indulged in. you know, once, once you hit 18 or so, you know, eat like an adult. Like,

0 (8m 14s):
I'm still wait, I'm still waiting to, to learn that lesson. You mentioned Polsky that I had him on the show recently. Yeah. What do you think most people Misunderstand about stress? Obviously he's contributed an awful lot to this. I know you've thought about this too. Yeah. What do you think people don't understand fully about stress?

1 (8m 29s):
Yeah. The findings that I think are overlooked tremendously are the following experiment. There's an experiment in animals where a rat is given the opportunity to run on a treadmill and rats and, and rodents of all kinds love kinds, love running on treadmills, you know, they're these interesting, this, we'll see who catches this fly first. Yeah.

0 (8m 47s):
I'm, I'm ready, man. Yeah.

1 (8m 49s):
The, I think, you know, there's even a study from hoppy hofstra's lab at at Harvard that showed that if you put wheels, running wheels in fields, that rodents will run there in the middle of the night and run on them. That's how insanely obsessed with running.

0 (9m 3s):
They're just energetic. They wanna go, there's

1 (9m 5s):
Something rewarding about it for them, but in any event, it lowers their blood pressure. It leads to, in improvements in a number of metrics that you expect. And you see the same thing in humans, right? Who run on a treadmill or run outdoors or swim cardiovascular exercise. Okay. Well, Polsky and I love to talk about a, an experiment where they took two different cages with animals. One is running voluntarily, but then that running wheel is tethered to a running wheel in another cage that encloses an animal, forces it to run every time the other one runs. So forced exercise versus voluntary exercise. And the takeaway is very straightforward. Voluntary exercise leads to all sorts of improvements in health metrics, resting heart rate, blood pressure, blood co glucose, resting blood glucose, et cetera, awake and blood glucose.

1 (9m 52s):
The animal that's forced to exercise, you see the opposite, right? So it's not exercise per se, it's something about being forced to exercise is causes decrements in a number of health metrics. And you see the same thing in humans. So what's wild is my colleague, Dr. Ali Crum, department of psychology at Stanford has done these beautiful experiments on mindset and belief. These are not placebo effects. And what she's shown in, in a just absolutely spectacular way is that if people watch a short video about all the ways in which stress can really diminish your health, well then indeed stress diminishes their health. Whereas if a separate group watches an a factual also five minute also factual tutorial on all the ways that stress can enhance performance by harnessing your ability to focus memory formation, et cetera, all of which is true, that's indeed what you see.

0 (10m 43s):
Can I give you my favorite one that I learned about over the last year? Yes. So the Boston Marathon bombing 2012, about 10 years ago, 2016 maybe. Anyway, Boston Marathon bombing a study was done comparing people who had been at the actual marathon while the bomb had gone off, and people who had watched 90 minutes or more of news coverage about it. And the people who watched 90 minutes or more of news coverage about it showed a greater stress response than the people who'd literally lived through it.

1 (11m 15s):
Interesting. Interesting. Yeah. The, the, the, the mindset and belief effects are, are absolutely extraordinary and, and very real. Right? I mean, I think, you know, recently I've been reading and researching a lot about, and did a podcast on tenacity and willpower. Mm. And there was this idea early on from balmeister and colleagues that willpower is a limited resource. Some of that

0 (11m 40s):
E ego depletion, willpower, ego

1 (11m 41s):
Depletion. Yes. It was controversial. They showed that, you know, replenishing glucose in between hard tasks could restore willpower.

0 (11m 48s):
They showed that, was it juries or judges that were low in blood glucose were more likely to give harsh sentences, stuff like this.

1 (11m 55s):
Yeah. It, it sort of wicked out to a number of naturalistic situations and it made good sense. And then my colleague Carol Dweck, also in the psychology department at Stanford, most famously known for her work on mine growth mindset, did an experiment in which they essentially asked whether or not tenacity and willpower are limited in terms of being a, some sort of resource. And also whether or not it was somehow linked to glucose availability, fuel in the brain and body, and found that if people fought or were told that mine, that, excuse me, willpower was a limited resource, that's indeed what they observed experimentally. But that if they were taught or were told that willpower is unlimited and and divorced from glucose levels, well then that's exactly what you saw.

0 (12m 42s):
So you say, so saying that learning about ego depletion and believing that willpower is a limited resource is an information hazard that is self-fulfilling

1 (12m 51s):
Potentially. Now, now, now, now, B Balmeister, you know, showed himself to be, you know, pretty determined when and countered the, the, the dweck counter by showing that if indeed if there's a hard task followed by a hard task, then your beliefs about willpower can impact your performance on the second task. So d the AK Dweck is right, but that if you have a hard task, hard task, and then another hard task, so back to back to back tasks or more, which is a lot of what life is like. Well then it seems that the w that the willpower is a limited resource and glucose supporting will willpower theory holds up a bit better.

0 (13m 31s):
What have you come to believe about the difference between willpower and motivation and discipline? How, how do kind of all of these fit together in your mind?

1 (13m 39s):
Yeah. So willpower and tenacity are related to motivation, but they're not quite the same. I think we should think of motivation as a, as the verb state that moves us from, let's just say apathy to tenacity. Okay. So it's, it's sort, it is the verb function that moves us along that continuum. App, apathy at one end, tenacity and willpower. Strong exertion of willpower at the other end. One of the most interesting structures in the entire nervous system is one that gets very little coverage. Unfortunately, in fact, most neuroscientists aren't aware of what its function is. And it's called the AMCC, which the anterior mid singulate cortex, you have one on each side of the brain.

1 (14m 22s):
The name isn't really important, but we want to, you know, to, to the credit of the, of the structure. We should name it the AMCC. The AMCC receives inputs from a lot of interesting brain areas related to reward related to autonomic function. So how alert or sleepy we are to prediction, to prediction error. It's a hub for many, many inputs and outputs, hormone systems, et cetera. Beautiful experiments done by my colleague Joe Zi at Stanford have shown that if you stimulate this brain area, a tiny little brain area in a human, they immediately feel as if some challenge is impending and they're going to meet that challenge. It's a forward center of mass against challenge response.

1 (15m 4s):
This has been seen in independent subjects. They do controls where they then tell them they're stimulating, but they're not actually stimulating. And they're like, I don't feel anything. You can turn on and off tenacity and willpower. So there's literally a hub for this. Now here's where it gets really interesting. I'm gonna list off a bunch of peer reviewed publish results in rapid sequence. And I'm happy to point out the, the substantiation for this or the references. Okay. Individuals that are dieting or resisting some sort of tempting behavior and are successful in doing that, the size and activity in their AM MCC goes up over time and the structure gets bigger. Dieters who fail flat or downward trajectory of the size and activation of the AM MCC, this can be taken too far.

1 (15m 47s):
Individuals with anorexia nervosa, the most deadly of all psychiatric disorders where a dep self deprivation of food activates excessive reward. There's this kind of loop of reward. Their accs are significantly greater size than others. So there's, you know, this can be taken too far. Super ages, which is a bit of a misnomer because these individuals are people who maintain healthy cognitive function similar to people in their twenties and thirties, into their seventies, eighties, and nineties. Their AMCC maintains or increases in size into their later years. Typical ages the size of, we always hear that you lose brain mass across your lifespan. Well, most of it is from the AMCC and beautifully, and this is two of my favorite results that really bring this around to a protocol or a takeaway.

1 (16m 33s):
If people are given an easy task, the AMCC isn't activated. If they're given a hard task in particular, a hard task, physical or cognitive, that they really don't want to do. The AMCC levels of activity go through the roof. And here's what's really cool. They gave aging, let's, you know, people age 60 to 79, the task of adding three hours extra per week of cardiovascular exercise. Now that's a lot, right? Three one hour, they call them aerobic classes, but getting their heart rate up to about 65, 70% of, of maximum. So it's getting into like zone three ish area. Yeah, people can look up zone three, but you nailed it. Zone three, the size of their AM CCC increased across that six month protocol and offset the normal age related decline in this, in this area in terms of its size.

1 (17m 24s):
The theory that's starting to emerge is that the AMCC isn't just about tenacity and willpower to push through hard things, that it may actually be related to one's will to live, one's will to continue living. And I think this is, these are some of the most important results. By the way, I didn't participate in any of the research that I just described. I spent a lot of time with that literature. But I think it's so important. I mean, we hear about the amygdala, the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, all of very important brain structures. But if nothing else, hopefully this conversation one, put the amm CCC on the map,

0 (17m 53s):
The one that literally could create your will to live is the one that's been overlooked a little bit.

1 (17m 57s):
Right? And, and it can be, and what's interesting about this structure is that it's involved in generating tenacity and willpower for all things, not just for one situation. And what's really wonderful, I think about the, the research literature on this is it's so clear what we need to do. We need to do thi let's say like me, you, you're a person who enjoys weightlifting and you love running. I love those two activities. Well guess what? Those activities, even if they're hard, like a hard run that I'm really enjoying, or some hard sets in the gym, not going to increase the size or activity of the AMCC. People love to over romanticize the utility of those final two reps. Sure, okay. Pushing to failure, great, you know, running hard till your lungs burn great.

1 (18m 38s):
But if you enjoy that, you're not increasing your amount of tenacity and willpower, at least according to the research data, what's going to do it is doing something, what I call micro sucks or macro sucks, you know? And so micro sucks could be all the little things that you don't want during to do during the day. Macros sucks, could be the larger things. But of course you don't want to do things that are going to damage you psychologically or physically. Of course, of course. But everyone I believe would benefit from picking a few micro sucks

0 (19m 6s):
To do. What are some of your micros sucks or macro sucks that you could sprinkle throughout the day?

1 (19m 11s):
Okay, so on a household maintenance level, you know, I, I maintain a very clean home. I, I, I'm constantly throwing things away as well, but there are a few things, like once I exceed a certain number of dishes in the sink, it becomes this, okay, I'll, I'll load the dishwasher later type thing. Like a micro suck for me will be like, especially if something's been in there for a while and it's kind of gross, and then you gotta like work through it. And of course I try and put each dish away as, as I, you know, dirty them up. But so little things, the things that, that the, I really don't want to deal with that right now. That's the kind of thing, those harder tasks where you have to breach some barrier, some resistance to put it into, you know, Stephen Pressfield language or our friend David Goggins. Right? you know, that this idea that one has to callous the mind.

1 (19m 53s):
I mean it, David said that, right?

0 (19m 55s):
He's probably gotten hypertrophied AM CCC that's bigger than most people's

1 (19m 58s):
Pro probably. And, and the, the beauty of having a an AMCC that's highly, you know, available for activation is that, you know, through the micro and the macro sucks of the day. You, you have this thing, it's like an engine that you can devote to other things. So then you can devote the AMCC to other endeavors. I

0 (20m 17s):
Have this thing I called email anxiety, and it's when my unread inbox reaches three figures or more. And that's when it just, it kind of follows me around like a poltergeist. There you go throughout the day. And that, that absolutely, for me, that's probably a macro suck, you know, to get through that. It's probably three to four hours. A lot of it's scheduling. When's this guest coming on? I need to speak to this partner. We got blah, blah, blah. So yeah, I I feel that, what else?

1 (20m 42s):
It's subjective, right? I mean, what's a, what sucks is subjective. Someone else

0 (20m 44s):
Might love emails.

1 (20m 45s):
Yeah. Someone might. And and I think that, you know, you've talked a lot on your show with various guests about, you know, when we're in too much comfort our, we're not meeting our goals. I love deadlines for that reason. I, I love deadlines. I love pressure. I think,

0 (21m 1s):
I think Parkinson's law is as close to a thermodynamic of productivity as we can get. Do you know what I mean? Like, when you have a deadline, you will meet it, right? If you do not have a deadline, you will manana manana until forever.

1 (21m 15s):
That's right. And some people I think preload the deadline by procrastinating and then that's what, you know, gets their activation energy to a level where they can, they can engage. So I've started thinking about this a lot lately. you know, I love running, but it's interesting. I, I like to finish at my driveway and I live on a hill. And actually this morning I was out for a run and the gate at the end of the cul-de-sac is my sort of finish line designated stop point. So it actually sucked to do the last, you know, 20 meters this morning. So there I probably got a little bit of AMCC activation because everything was the number of negotiations I went through. Yep. When I turned up my street at the end of this run, whether or not I was gonna run this extra 20 meters was ridiculous. Yeah. I mean, the human brain, you know, struggling to not do this extra 20 meters, it was so silly.

1 (21m 58s):
So it's gotta, it's gotta hurt a little bit. Again, you don't wanna damage yourself, but I think in the context of, for instance, cognitive learning, getting to the point where you finish something and then forcing yourself to do one little extra bit there at the end. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I I, I'm not looking for any credit for it, but I, I wanna be very clear that the scientific literature doesn't call these things micro sucks. I call them micros sucks. Yeah. And I sort of put that out there just to make it clear as to what we're referring

0 (22m 23s):
To, to do you know, do you know Nick Bear? I don't. In Austin, he's a athlete and supplement. Oh, right.

1 (22m 28s):
Supplement

0 (22m 29s):
Company running. Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a hybrid athlete,

1 (22m 31s):
A larger guy. But he runs really fast. Does

0 (22m 33s):
Bodybuilding shows, does power lifting also runs, to

1 (22m 35s):
Be clear, I know that large guys run fast, but typically they don't run fast for 20 miles. Correct. And he does.

0 (22m 42s):
That's accurate. He, his little catchphrase is, go one more. And it's interesting what you're saying here is it's not just about the completion of the thing that you're doing, because a lot of the time, the thing that you choose to do, even the thing that's difficult is done under your own volition. Don't get me wrong. If you do a difficult CrossFit workout, Fran, whatever, 2159 of thrusters and polyps, it is awful. It's hell. Right? There's literally a name for what your throat feels like once you finish called Fran cough that people get from having taken their heart rate as high as spasming

1 (23m 15s):
Of the Yeah, yeah.

0 (23m 17s):
That taste of metal in the back of your throat. But what, what people are doing now, although they're doing something that's difficult, it's like volitionally difficult and it's within their domain of enjoyment. And what you're saying here is that we're, we're looking to just push ourselves a little bit past that. It's like an unnecessary amount of challenge. And I think that go one more makes quite a nice reminder for us with the micro sucker, the macro sock. Let's push ourselves just a little bit beyond where we would've got our sense of satisfaction. 'cause presumably you get the dopamine, I've completed the task. Fuck yeah. And then it's like, and then I do just that tiny little bit more to, that's to bring in other news.

Marek Health (23m 54s):
This episode is brought to you by Marck Health. I wanted to get my blood work done here in America. I'd been told by people like Dr. Hu that it's important for me to do, to work out what's going on inside of my body. But I didn't know where to go. After a ton of research, I found out that Mary Health is the best and most comprehensive. When I started working with them, my testosterone was 4 95, which is low normal, not where I wanted it to be. Now, six months later, it is 1006 and I'm not on TRT. That is what happens when you work with a proper comprehensive blood panel company who genuinely knows what they're doing with Marek Health. It's like having someone in your corner that is a properly trained clinician who knows exactly what's happening inside of your body and can give you personalized diet supplementation, training and pharmaceutical recommendations. Plus organize it all. It is a one-stop shop for your health. You can get the exact same medical panel and oversight that I got by going to the link in the description below or heading to mar health.com/ Modern Wisdom. And using the code Modern Wisdom a checkout for 10% off. That's M-A-R-E-K health.com/ Modern Wisdom and Modern Wisdom a checkout one person that I think has been really interesting from this side. Your good friends with Tom Segura? Yeah. Where

1 (25m 1s):
We're related. We're cousins. You're kidding

0 (25m 3s):
Me.

1 (25m 3s):
No, no, no. We're cousins.

0 (25m 5s):
I can see it now. Yeah. His commitment to Fitness has been pretty fascinating for me to see. And he's kind of treating his body like an athlete to facilitate his chosen pursuit of comedy. I think even Bert is trying to sort his sort of health and Fitness out one step at a time too.

1 (25m 21s):
Bert's the control experiment. Like there's a, if, if the experiment is about willpower, tenacity, and discipline, Tom is the, is the, is the con is the active condition and Bert is the control.

0 (25m 35s):
But I, I'm seeing more and more people now, especially performers that aren't using or that aren't within the realm of physical Fitness really starting to understand, if I want to perform outside of this, I need to think like an athlete. I need to be looking at my hydration. I mean, Tom had his trainer travel with him on the road for months.

1 (25m 53s):
Yeah. Yeah. Tom's really serious about his craft, as is Bert. They just have different approaches. And when it comes to Fitness, I, by the way, I noticed Bert is training. He's working out, I've been trying to get Bert to quit drinking alcohol for a while. Not because I'm the arbiter of, of, of who should do what. I ne I never tell people what to do, by the way, but provide information. People can do what they want. I'm gonna live And, let live, I wanna be very clear about that. But it's out of care and affection for, for Bert that, you know, excessive alcohol consumption over long periods of time. Bad. I mean, we can keep that one pretty brief. So, but Bert is working out, but Tom, I know 'cause we talk and I've spent some time with him that he trains, he trains hard and he sees it as integral with his, with his writing, with his ability to show up for his family and business, et cetera.

1 (26m 41s):
I mean, you, I think we're finally approaching a time in human history where we accept at the level of, you know, the scientific community all the way through to wellness and just generally that the brain and body are, are intimately linked at the level of what you, you know, if you want to improve your body, do something for your mind. If you want to improve your mind, do something for your body. And, and it's so clear now what we all need to do. I mean we, we can get into the details, but at a macro level, it's clear that we should all be getting that 150 to 200 minutes of zone two per week or walking a lot. If you live in a big city, you're probably getting that. But then also getting your heart rate up to, you know, max heart rate once a week doing some sprint type stuff on in whatever format is safe for your body. Some people it's swimming, some people it's rowing, some people it's running.

1 (27m 23s):
For me it's running. But you know, not everyone enjoys running or can do it. And then everyone should be doing at least six sets of resistance training per muscle group per week. Minimum hard sets two failure. Okay. Maybe, maybe not close to failure. Yeah, probably. And it's especially the groups that have been, let's just say averse to weight training, right? Typically women, el older folks, although now more women weight train. 'cause they understand that in the absence of a lot of injected or prescription anabolic hormones, they're not gonna get in enormous. That's

0 (27m 55s):
The funniest thing for me. That's fine.

1 (27m 57s):
Women died, I think, right? That that concept that, you know, if, if you won lifts weights, that they're gonna be get huge,

0 (28m 1s):
Become bulky. Do you realize to all of the women who are out there that are concerned about lifting weights because they're going to get too bulky. Do you know how hard I've worked to try and desperately become bulky for 15 years? Like I've worked really, really difficult hoping that one day I'll become bulky. And there is, I think it's dissipating a lot now, but there was for a long time this fear that, oh, do a couple of bicep calls and you're gonna look like the incredible Hulk. It's like me and my friends have really, really prayed for that to happen forever. You do not need to be concerned. It's not gonna creep up on you and one day you're gonna wake up and be this sort of vascular beast.

1 (28m 35s):
Right. A couple things about that. I mean, from a longevity standpoint, we know that maintaining healthy nerve to muscle function, neuromuscular junctions is one of the things that resistance exercise does. And it's highly correlated with cognitive function into older age. And for those people, I guess going back to our earlier conversation, we'll probably do this a few times in the course of, of, of this episode, but the thing you want to do the least, that's actually the thing that where you stand to build up your AMCC the most. So for me that would be language learning or learning of musical instruments. Two, two things that I love music and I, but I, I just, it's just so hard for me. So it's, it, it sits there on the shelf as a possible way to activate the AMCC.

1 (29m 15s):
But in terms of actual resistance training, resistance training has an interesting property that I haven't heard discussed before that pertains to men and women who do it, which is unlike cardiovascular training during resistance training bout because of the blood flow to the muscle that, so-called pump, you get a little window into what the potential progress would look like. That pump dissipates post-workout and then Yeah. Yeah. If, if you allow sufficient rest and nutrition, et cetera, you'll get a hypertrophy response. But it's so unlike other forms of exercise, like if I go to a yoga class and I stretch or I'm doing some movement, I get to that limit where I'm quaking and I fall over. It's very different than getting a picture of just how flexible I will be Yes.

1 (29m 59s):
The next time. Yes. And then losing that until I adapt. Yeah. With running your lungs, sometimes your throat burns as you pointed out and that's showing you your limit. And of course then there's an adaptation response that then allows you to perform at that level without the burning in the next time. Right. If you allow sufficient recovery. But with weight training, it's kind of interesting. The whole pump thing was never something that I really drew me to weight training very much. But it's interesting because you get a glimpse into what the, the progress might look like. And so for, I would say for anyone who's worried about getting too big, unless your pump is bigger than you want to be, yeah. You're not gonna get that. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so you actually get a window into how much potential size increase you're gonna create. But it's so different than other forms of exercise in that way.

1 (30m 41s):
It's like, what other thing in life? Like if you took a language class and you're like, oh, I'm gonna learn Japanese. And you go, and during the class you actually become fluent for a moment, then it's taken away and then you adapt and become fluent. So it's, it's a very special form of exercise that, that offers some unique gifts to us as incentives for going back. But look, as I say this, I realize some people hate resistance training. They love running. Some people hate running, they love resistance training. Some people I realize hate exercise. Yeah. But if you hate exercise, you should do it

0 (31m 9s):
Anyway. AMCC and you're

1 (31m 11s):
Getting the AM ccc So

0 (31m 12s):
Going back to what you think might be happening to someone like Tom, who is a, like a cognitive athlete, right? But largely the physical realm comedians, apart from, I guess until Joe, which is part of the beginning of like the comedian bro, bro lifter revolution before him. It wasn't exactly like, I wasn't looking to comedians as being the vanguard of health and Fitness and stuff like

1 (31m 36s):
That. No. It was like belu. I mean, look at Belushi, right? I mean he was the, he was the epitome of lack of health and sadly died. Right? So

0 (31m 42s):
What what, talk to me about what would be happening to the brain of somebody like Tom who pivots from being maybe 40 pounds overweight perhaps, I dunno how big he got at his, at his biggest, but lost a good bit of weight. And it wasn't just losing weight, it was then gaining muscle. So Dr. Gabrielle Lyon world of like muscle scented medicine, he's gonna benefit from that. The insulin sensitivity. There'll be like some physiological changes. But talk to me for the people who are cognitive athletes, what's gonna happen in someone like Tom's mind when he changes his body?

1 (32m 11s):
Yeah. So improved blood flow to the brain. I mean the brain is most metabolically demanding organ in the entire body. It consumes a ton of glucose. If you eat carbohydrates, yes it can run on ketones, but blood flow through arteries, veins and capillaries to the neurons of the brain is, is it's inseparable from cognitive function. So when you improve blood flow to the brain, you improve cognitive function, period. When you restrict blood flow to the brain, even at a, at a micro level, you impair cognitive function. In addition to that, we know that several forms of age-related cognitive decline in dementia are considered nowadays. Some people will even call it type three diabetes, although that's a controversial term, diabetes of the brain.

1 (32m 51s):
This is why a number of people who have Alzheimer's go on ketogenic diets and get some degree of relief. It's not that it by the way, it's not a cure for Alzheimer's, but some people do better when they switch the major fuel source for the brain. But in the case of Tom as an example, but someone who gets into exercising regularly, both resistance training and cardiovascular training, you're getting improved blood flow, you're getting far less inflammation of the brain. Inflammation is cognitive depleting, reducing inflammation, cognitive enhancing. We all, we that's absolutely true across the board, right? In animal studies and humans. In addition to that, there are a lot of bloodborne factors. Two of which I'll just highlight now just for sake of time only too. First of all, when we do cardio that it positively impact brain health and memory in particular.

1 (33m 36s):
So when we do load bearing cardiovascular exercise, so running as opposed to swimming, anything where, where the skeletal system is, is under some load, there's a hormone that's literally secreted from bone. I know we don't normally think of bones as endocrine organs called osteocalcin. Osteocalcin is released from the bones under these load-bearing conditions. It can cross the blood-brain barrier. And we know that it plays an active role in promoting not just new cell production, but 'cause that's a more minor component of neuroplasticity, but enhancement of nerve health and function in the hippocampus, which is an area that's instrumental for the formation of new memories.

1 (34m 19s):
So there's something about movement of the body that signals to the brain, ah, we're, you know, we're moving you, you actually need to maintain or perhaps even enhance your ability to remember things. And this probably is an evolutionary conserved circuit that exists. We know it exists in mice as well. So that's one, one example. The other is that my colleague at Stanford Stanford, Tony Weiss, Corey is best known for these young blood experiments where they'll take the blood or plasma from a young rodent and put it into an aged or demented rodent and see improvements in cognitive function. And outside the United States, there are some clinics, by the way, I'm not recommending people do this, that have shown improvements in cognitive function or even offsetting of, of Alzheimer's and HLA cognitive decline.

1 (34m 59s):
This has led to the idea of like vampires and baby blood and this whole adrenochrome Yeah. Drink. It's, which is all crazy and conspiracy. I go on record saying that. But there's a recent paper that also from Tony's lab showing that if in animals that exercise regularly, if you take their blood or plasma and you supply that blood or plasma to aged or cognitively deficient animals, they, they're cognition or their cognitive abilities improve. So there's something about blood of the exercised body that enriches the brain. It could be many different growth factors. It could be BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor. It could be things like IGF one insulin like growth factor.

1 (35m 40s):
It's probably gonna be a, a cocktail of different things as well as osteocalcin. And so what we want to think about is that when we exercise, and that's a broad statement exercise or word rather cardiovascular resistance training. It creates like a cocktail that then crosses into the blood, blood-brain barrier that then creates a milieu of general growth health or at least maintenance of, of cognitive tissue that's there. So Tom's incredibly sharp and of course comedy requires not just memory, but also writing of new jokes. Right? He's, he's gotta do Netflix specials for a long time. And I actually went and saw him in Aspen, a small venue. I flew out there to see him 'cause I wanted to see him in a small venue. 'cause in small venues is where comics often work out their new material.

1 (36m 21s):
Hmm. And I mean just, you know, to me it was just astonishing, like to see the number of different thought threads. And one thing that makes Tom's comedy so wonderful and other people like Richard Pryor to this exceptionally well too, is that he can switch personas very fast. So he's doing his voice, then he switches to his son's voice and switches back. And the speed and precision with which he does that very agile makes it seem you, we forget that they're very agile. And then we, we've, he creates a, a panel of characters and then wipes that board away, right? He's the only guy up there, wipes that board away and then creates a panel of new characters. And so, I mean, that requires a lot of dex like cognitive dexterity. So exercise is absolutely one of the best ways to improve brain function over time.

1 (37m 2s):
And in addition to that, you know, there's been so much interest in, you know, should we do crossword puzzles? Should we, you know, why is it that some people maintain cognitive function? I think what's very clear to me based on all that literature is that it's not one specific thing. Crossword puzzles or social engagement or exercises, all of those things. But let's not forget the super ages, the people who are constantly trying things that are difficult, that are pressuring themselves a bit to do things that are difficult. Those people are offsetting as far as we know, all of the major shrinkage of these brain structures that normally would shrink as people age. So we have a lot of control, but it does require effort. And I'll tell you, there's never gonna be a pillar injection it, whether or not it's ozempic or something Like it.

1 (37m 46s):
But for the brain, there's just no, there's no way, there's no way that you're ever going to recapitulate learning and effort. And yes, it requires time, but it, it's so clear. I mean, I don't know how many more papers in preclinical models and in humans one needs to see before they finally just, you know, bite the bullet and go and lift weights, lift weights and run or, and do cardiovascular training. It's, it can't be one or the other. Yeah. you know, the, the, the stereotype of like the, the big, let's just say big guy who's dumb, you know, I, I don't think it's entirely, I mean, to meet some big, big folks that are smart, right? Yeah. But there is something in the kind of broad correlations of people who, you know, ru people who tend to only do cardiovascular training.

1 (38m 31s):
you know, maybe it's, it's a selection bias. Like it, they're the people who are already avid readers or more in kind of intellectual leanings, maybe get more involved in tennis, swimming, running type sports, rowing because of the schools they went to or whatever. But people who just lift weights. It does seem as if over time, I don't know, maybe Derek would tell us their neck is getting too big, they have sleep apnea. It, it, they, they don't seem as sharp and they're often mouth breathers. Look at the really big guys in the gym. They're often

0 (38m 60s):
Not stronger in

1 (39m 1s):
Your, not just between sets, not after, just after hard sets. They're, I think they're also, they're asphyxiating themselves in sleep. We know this. Yeah. And then you look at runners and the people that have the, kinda like the really spelt and, and And, they, and sure they might maintain cognitive function, but their bodies are very vulnerable to injury. Project And, they always seem to be complaining about what hurts. you know, like my friends who do a lot of extended training, unless it's David Goggins who doesn't seem to have the circuit for complaining. Hmm. At least certainly not online. Yeah. There always seem to be complaining about about injuries. So I think a combination of resistance training and cardiovascular training is, let's just face it. Like you can't do one and not the other.

1 (39m 41s):
If you want to be healthy all around healthy of heart, healthy of body, healthy of mind, cognition improved or, or at least maintained as we age, you gotta do both.

LMNT (39m 50s):

1 (40m 49s):
Coming back to the discussion about alcohol, which is one that you tried to interject with Bert on, I think your episode that you released last year. Yeah. Back end of last summer. Yeah. I think that really opened a lot of people's eyes to some of the Risks of alcohol. I've been kind of flying the flag of it as a tool for productivity for quite a while to avoid Alcohol.

0 (41m 10s):
Yeah. That I think when you entirely,

1 (41m 12s):
Or, or do you, do you drink at all?

0 (41m 14s):
I've brought it back into my life now, but I did six months sober three times and then a thousand days without alcohol too. But yeah, I'm seeing right now a huge pushback against unseen, unintentional drinking. And I think that yeah, your episode last year opened a lot of people's eyes to it.

1 (41m 35s):
Thanks. I mean, again, I, I don't tell people what to do. I give them the facts and so they can make the best decisions for them. I mean, it's very clear that unless you're an alcoholic and provided you're an adult, that, you know, two drinks per week maximum is about the upper threshold beyond which you're gonna start getting some health. De de that's

0 (41m 53s):
Detriments. That's, that's, that's called a warmup to a warmup in

1 (41m 55s):
England. Yeah. So I, you know, I've never been a big drinker. I don't drink, I, I'm lucky that it's not something that's, that's a strong draw for me. Me too. you know, I have friends that are recovered alcoholics and, you know, their lives are so much better as a function of being sober. But for non alcoholics, I mean, I think everyone should just know the, the health Risks, especially women where the Risks for breast cancer and other types of cancers are, are elevated. So very much. And what was interesting to me about the response to that episode is that I think many people took it, my, the impression I got was that many people took it as permission to finally stop drinking or drink less because they didn't enjoy drinking. And as you so, you know, beautifully put out on social media, you know, drinking is one of the few activities that if you don't partake, people assume or accuse you of having a problem.

1 (42m 45s):
And it's just wild. I mean, like, why would that be? And I think that, I think it'd also make, once actually, I was out to dinner with a colleague years ago and I declined drinking that evening. I was just talking to the, the visiting speaker and she said, God, that's so boring. And I, well, first of all, I don't have a problem saying what's on my mind without alcohol. Right. I don't have, I don't have a excessive GABAergic inhibition. So I'll say what I want to say, you know, as, as best I can. But, you know, I think drinkers don't like people who don't drink because it takes the fun out of it for them. Because there's this idea that's, you know, prolific on college campuses. Like if everyone's drunk that somehow, like the entire like vibe of the party is gonna take on a new, new flavor.

1 (43m 32s):
And, and frankly, I remember I went to a college, uc, Santa Barbara, where at the time people drank a ton, a ton discovered alcoholics, you know? Right. And I used to go to parties, sometimes I'd look around, I'm thinking like, everyone here is just blasted. Like, if anything happened, were you

0 (43m 49s):
Drinking? Did you drink in college?

1 (43m 50s):
Yeah, I drank in college, but not that often. I, I had a habit and I don't recommend this. I had a habit of going out about once a month and I would tie one on, you know, absolutely

0 (43m 59s):
Infrequent, but binge.

1 (44m 1s):
Yeah. I never, you know, I, my tolerance to alcohol was always such that I would get drunk quickly and then sober up really fast. So I was drinking late into the night, but then I'd sober up really fast. Now, of course, we know the sleep you get after even one drink is vastly diminished.

0 (44m 16s):
Every single person that's got a aura or a whoop strap or something is feeling you right now.

1 (44m 21s):
And I think that alcohol to me never felt good. I never liked it. And it was a recipe for, you know, there was a lot of fights, there was a lot of, you know, there were a lot of bad stuff happens when people are drinking too much.

0 (44m 34s):
Dude, I've, I've,

1 (44m 34s):
I've run drunk driving to say nothing of poor decision making. Yeah. I mean, I, to me it just feels like there's so, there's so many better ways to have a good time that, that, that alcohol isn't necessary. But I do understand that it's a big part of many cultures. And I do understand that for many people it's so part and parcel with relaxing and with festivities. Mm. And with feeling comfortable and withdrawing a boundary between the normal day and the rest of the day.

0 (45m 2s):
That's interesting. There's a ritualistic aspect to it. Yeah.

1 (45m 4s):
There's this sort of divides the day in an interesting way. So I'm not judgemental of it. I, but for me, I mean, I've, I'll go to a party where people are drinking and just hang out. I'm perfectly good,

0 (45m 13s):
Dude. I've stood on the door of a thousand club nights in my career, right. As a club promoter. And I can promise you for the people that are thinking, I like the sound of this justification, this excuse that I don't need to drink anymore. Dr. Cuman has said that, you know, maybe it's not for you. Maybe it's not as enjoyable. Nothing good happens in nightclubs after one in the morning. I am patient zero. I have the, I am the doctor of late night parties. Okay. Like, that's one of my expertise. Nothing good happens in the nightclub. It's this sort of messy, sloppy fights and kissing people you shouldn't and, and, and stumbling all over the place and stuff.

0 (45m 55s):
If you go out and you don't drink and you go home at one in the morning, I think you probably get to capture about 80% of the enjoyment of the event that you would've done had you have drank pre-drinks, gone out, done the whole thing. And I got a bit of push, I got quite a bit of pushback from a, a sobriety community a few years ago. I did this a thousand days sober as a club promoter, which was, I guess like a kind of a big deal in, in some regards for like pushing the sobriety community forward. But I was never doing it because I had a problem. I was doing it because it gave me more consistency and more time and more money to spend on things that I cared about. So it was a, a productivity tool like, like the pomodora technique, right. Or going to bed on time or something.

0 (46m 36s):
And they had a little bit of a problem. They had a big problem with the fact that I said there is something to the enjoyment of drinking on a night out. I think anybody that says alcohol has no role in improving the quality of a night out ever just hasn't been on enough good nights out. Right. There, there are ways that it can improve, kind of loosens people up. It can reduce their inhibitions if you wanna go and dance, you know, you're dancing at a rave or, or at a, a festival, which I think there's one going on quite close to here. If you're there, it's really great.

1 (47m 8s):
But

0 (47m 10s):
If alcohol wasn't so widely distributed, I think people would ask a lot more questions. It's like, you can't see the word for the trees. Right. You, you don't question it. It's such a, it's baked into the, the fabric of, of just human life. Every single time that I take a, like a macro dose, but low of psilocybin one where I can still function,

1 (47m 30s):
But what, what is, what is

0 (47m 31s):
0.7, five, 0.75 to one gram of, so

1 (47m 34s):
That, so that's about, it's a little less than half of the macro therapeutic dose for, for intractable depression, which is something like 2.2 grams or so.

0 (47m 43s):
So, so you can still hold a conversation depending on what strain you've got. But every single time that I do it without fail, a thought comes into my mind, which is, why does anyone drink alcohol? Why does anybody do it? Because I'll go to bed, my HRV my recovery's fine the next day. Maybe I'm a little bit tired. Like I've had a lot of like activation. I've been super energetic, very little hangover on the evening. I don't do stupid things. It makes me want to say nice things to all of my friends. My thoughts are sharper than they were before. Sometimes they're silly, but they're sharper. And then you compare it with alcohol and it's this kind of sloppy, muddy, very unile. It's, it's just, I I, I totally get what you mean.

0 (48m 24s):
When you've taken a little bit of time away from it and you look at it in the harsh light of day, the effects that alcohol gives you just aren't that enjoyable. And it's been folded into people's lives through tradition and through just anchoring bias and continuation. Yeah. And

1 (48m 38s):
Marketing, you know, the idea that like someone can quote unquote hold their liquor is such like a, it's been made synonymous with, you know, masculine ideals. It's like, I mean it's, it's kind of crazy 'cause we know it also, it crushes testosterone levels. What's interesting is that, you know, I, I forget who said this, but you know, there's a very different picture of a young drunk versus an old drunk, you know, someone who's been just drinking for too many years. It's not a pretty picture. That sucks. They become infantile. They become really infantile. And you know, again, I'm, I'm not the antica crusader. We did, I did that episode not expecting much of a response actually.

1 (49m 18s):
But that shows just how out of, out of touch sometimes I can be.

0 (49m 21s):
And I think, just to reiterate it, man, I think it gave people the excuse. Yeah. What you did is you gave people the justification, you legitimized them. It's like the best bucks tell you something that you already know. It was like they, everyone, always a lots of people always had an idea. I probably shouldn't be drinking. Maybe I don't enjoy it that much. Maybe these aren't my friends, they're just my drinking partners. Maybe I don't like the way that I feel the next day. Maybe my life could be better if I stop drinking. There's the justification.

1 (49m 48s):
Well, I'm happy to hear that for those folks. you know, now that the information is out there, I've, I was accused several times on Twitter slash X of taking all the fun out of parties in the, at least in the Bay Area. But I'll tell you, I grew up in the Bay Area. The good parties ended a long time ago. Ha. But they still exist. you know, I mean, I think they're, you know, and when I say other ways to have fun, I don't mean like, oh, everyone should sit around and do math or read neuroscience. Although for me, that's fun. you know, I think, I think in a broader sense, I think there's a shift nowadays that people really think about, you know, how to engage socially in ways that are interesting. I mean, perhaps it's a, again, a sampling bias because of the topics that I cover and who talks to me.

1 (50m 29s):
But, you know, like in the Bay Area, there are these Russian babanas in New York, they're spy 88, by the way. They don't pay me and say this, but I like to go this Russian bonia down in Wall Street. You go there and, you know, get hot saunas and coal plunge, and people are, you know, young people are there enjoying themselves, And they actually serve alcohol. So they'll have, sometimes they'll do like little gimlets of, of vodka or something there. And so, you know, people, sometimes that's part of the tradition. The

0 (50m 51s):
Most Russian thing that I can think of, shot of vodka whilst

1 (50m 54s):
Hot. Right? So that, and, you know, and they've got theories as to how that can help and listen. I think some of those traditions can really be wonderful. But, you know, people are starting to combine socializing with health promoting protocols and, you know, going out and eating good food together, like eating really wonderful food with the social component. The, you know, I, I'll go into the grave talking about getting morning sunlight. Something that maybe we should talk a little bit more about. And as people like roll their eyes, I'll just say there's this incredible study now just out in Nature mental health published about 80, that has 85,000, 85,000 subjects showing that the ratio of getting a lot of sunlight during the day, to getting minimal artificial light exposure at night.

1 (51m 35s):
It really sets the tone of your overall system and is, and is associated with brain and body that is and is associated with better mental health outcomes across the board. And the inverse, right? If you're getting too much artificial light at night or not enough sunlight or booth is associated with everything bad, elevate, depression, anxiety, et cetera. Now, I do believe people should get out and have a good time. Don't avoid the bright lights of a city or a club. Yep. Have a great time like dancing, socializing. Those are great reasons to stay up too late Yep. And get minimal sleep or sleep in the next day. Great reasons. So every once in a while, sure. 20% of your life you're gonna do that. And you're probably some percentage of time is also gonna be raising kids. So you're up because you have to, to keep, keep them alive, which is important to our species. So thank you. But I think people, you know, forget that yes, you can go outside and get morning sunlight and which I highly recommend people do that as, as most people know.

1 (52m 22s):
But I mean, so many benefits on mood and mental health and improved sleep that it, you just, and it's completely zero cost, you know? But I often get accused of, okay, well, but what if you have kids? Like, how do you do this? Well, you take the kids with you. 'cause guess what? They need it too. You, you take them outside, you eat breakfast outside, or at least facing a window indoors. It's not gonna be as good as having the window open or being outdoors. But even if the sun's on the other side of your apartment building, I mean, these things have an outsized positive effect on health. And I'll wager both upper limbs anyway, that many, many, many of the mental health issues that we see nowadays in young people and in adults is the consequence of disrupted circadian rhythms.

1 (53m 3s):
Because of a lot of time in a two dimensional screen space, which I'm not condemning, I spend time on and put out most of my content on social media and YouTube apple Spotify. Right. And in addition to that too, the lights are too bright at night and they're not getting enough sunlight during the day. And an important thing to understand about our circadian slash health, you know, circadian system and health is that throughout in the morning and throughout the day, your eyes are less sensitive to light, and you need more of it in order to get what you need. Okay. Broadly speaking. And at night, your eyes are far more sensitive to artificial lighting and you need far less of it in order to disrupt your circadian system in bad ways, disrupt your mental health.

1 (53m 45s):
Now does that mean you have to walk around with sunglasses at night and, you know, dimm all the lights in your house? Well, no, but you could afford to dimm them a little bit. You could afford to switch to the red light function on your phone. There's actually a triple click red light function on every phone that maybe I'll pass. The, the, the throughput of what to do to your phone. It's, which allows you to eliminate

0 (54m 4s):
Blues accessibility functions on on iPhone. On iPhone. I I think mine goes to iPhone. Mine goes to grayscale when I do that. Yeah,

1 (54m 9s):
You can, yeah. So you can have it switch to grayscale or to purely red. you know, you eliminate the blues. A trick that my friend Rick Rubin taught me I was like, oh, this is great. you know, you don't, you know, you don't necessarily have to purchase blue blocker glasses or anything like that. We'll get

Mudwtr (54m 20s):

1 (55m 17s):
So there are a bunch of little things that we can do that make a vast improvement in the way that our biology and psychology function. And it, it's amazing when you start to think about how most people exist now, it's too dimm, not enough light for them during the day, especially not enough sunlight. And that's too bright for them at night. And they're also living mostly in a two-dimensional world of screens. What's,

0 (55m 37s):
What's the problem with the two-dimensional thing?

1 (55m 39s):
Well, the, you know, the, we have an epidemic of myopia, of nearsightedness, and it's been shown in a bunch of different clinical trials now. The first couple of 'em that were attacked, like most studies, something comes out, then it gets attacked. Then there's a retaliation study, et cetera, that kids that spend two hours or more out of doors per day have a far lower incidence of myopia nearsightedness. And even if they're on iPads and, and books and computers, there's something about far viewing, about viewing things further than three or four feet away from us on a frequent, for a significant portion of our day. Doesn't mean you have to be staring off into the horizon, but as opposed to near viewing where you're looking at something within about four feet of oneself, this distance that we're sitting across from one another is about, probably about four and a half, five feet is, it's not quite far viewing, but you think about watch people's behavior, look at how they go through the day.

1 (56m 26s):
They're spending most of their time looking at things about a foot to a foot and a half away. And as a consequence, the eyeball gets longer. This is a well established fact in animal models and humans. And then the visual image isn't focused onto the retina, the light sensing portion at the back of the eye, the image falls in front of the retina. So-called nearsightedness. Right? It's falling too near to the lens. Okay. There are other, some people claim that nearsightedness has to do with the actual perceptual changes, but in any event, so fortunately that the eyeball actually can change in length. So viewing things further away can actually, especially early in life, allow the eyeball to adjust its shape. Amazing. Just like the sinuses, these, there's plasticity of a lot of different organs. Hmm.

1 (57m 6s):
And so the point is that we need to get out and view things at a distance. If you're walking down the street looking at your phone, you're, you're, you're degrading the functioning of your visual system. Well,

0 (57m 15s):
I told you, I, I think I texted you before I did it. I got laser eye surgery a month ago. Oh

1 (57m 19s):
Yeah. So you got the lasik. Yes. Great. And that's, so the LASIK just to, you know, educate people is to actually change the shape of the eyeball somewhat in order to make it more perfect optically in a way that for many people allows them to not have to wear corrective lenses of any kind. Yeah,

0 (57m 35s):
I can see everything. I can see your ancestral trauma and, and, and full works now at a hundred yards. Amazing.

1 (57m 42s):
Your vision is super sharp now.

0 (57m 44s):
Correct? Oh, it's 2015. What,

1 (57m 46s):
What was the, was the surgery painful?

0 (57m 48s):
It's very interesting. So I actually videoed it. I haven't put it up because it's kind of, it's probably pretty uncomfortable for people to watch

1 (57m 54s):
That's never stopped you before.

0 (57m 56s):
That's true. That's true. So they numb both of your eyes using numbing drops. Okay. And then they come over the top with a kind of a, a large box on an arm. They rest the valve of the front of this box on the eyeball itself, and then suck the eyeball onto the actual valve so that it can't move. They then use one laser to create a flap in the cornea, which is at the precise distance based on all of the tests that they did in the days prior to that. They then take it off you, you're still lying back. You have to keep looking at a green light that's above you.

0 (58m 37s):
The surgeon will lift the flap, the front flap of the cornea up. Yep. Using kind of a soft pair of tweezers. Yep. The laser will then come in behind, now the opened part of the cornea, do the corrective surgery. The flap will then get replaced. And, and it needs to be very, very, very precise so that any slight nudge, I actually had to go and get the, I had to get my flap re-listed a couple of days later on my left eye because a tiny, tiny, tiny little bit of oil from the top of my eyelid had been caught underneath the flap. And it was causing a flaring of bright lights. And so I had to go back and actually get the flap re-listed, get this, the flap that they make can still be re-listed up to three years later.

1 (59m 21s):
Amazing.

0 (59m 22s):
It's fascinating. And yeah, had it done on both eyes, couple of one day of recovery, it feels very gritty for the people that are concerned about whether or not it's, it's gonna like hurt them. And my recovery period was one day and I was able to, I recorded a podcast 48 hours in bright lights, 48 hours afterward. Was

1 (59m 40s):
It an expensive procedure?

0 (59m 41s):
Four grand. GBP. So five grand USD

1 (59m 44s):
Not a trivial sum,

0 (59m 45s):
Not a trivial sum, but also given that it's literally how you navigate the world. Sure. And I was squinting a lot. I was squinting at screens to have read the text. I was using really large text. The only reason I found out about this is because I went in for a checkup, And, they got me to do my eye test, and the lady turned and said, yeah, you, you legally can't drive without glasses. And I was like, what are you talking about? My vision's? My vision's great. Like, my vision's always been like this, but she got me to do the thing. And I thought, yeah, it shouldn't be, I should be able to read those huge letters that are only 20 feet away from me, shouldn't I? And sure enough, after this corrective surgery, 2015 vision, everything's razor sharp.

0 (1h 0m 27s):
The only considerations that I would say are nighttime viewing of bright lights, specifically street lights, cars coming toward you. You get a little bit of flaring around them. And that's because it's now passing through not just one piece of material, but there is a second cut that supposedly dissipates a little bit over time. But I am flying the flag for laser eye treatment, man. It's, it's been a complete game changer. My pickleball game's improved, which is obviously what was most important. Everything's, it's really, really good. And I'm, I'm very, very impressed and thank you to my surgeon for doing it.

1 (1h 1m 2s):
Yeah. So the, this little flap, did they tell you how big the flap is?

0 (1h 1m 6s):
I can just show you the video. Okay. I can show you the video once we finish up.

1 (1h 1m 10s):
Interesting. Thanks for sharing that. Yeah. I, I think it's an interesting procedure. And we did an episode with our chair of ophthalmology. Yeah. Jeff Goldberg. And he was a proponent of it for people that are, you know, i

0 (1h 1m 23s):
The means Yeah. I, I text, I texted you to make sure that like the, the ophthalmologist guy with all of the dudes that know it, like, am am I all right to do this?

1 (1h 1m 28s):
Jeff's amazing, actually, we, we trained at, in the same lab. He was a graduate student, I was a postdoc, then he ended up in Miami and then we conversion San Diego. Then when he moved to Stanford, I moved to Stanford. So I, we sort of, he'll argue I was tracking him. I'll argue he was tracking me, but he's my chairman. So I'll just say I was tracking him, whatever. But very, very smart guy. And, and I think, yeah, getting, keeping your eyes healthy is key. This actually comes back to light. So there's some really beautiful data of Glen Jeffrey's laboratory at University College London. I've known Glen for more than 20 years. He's a spectacular vision scientist showing that exposure to artificial red light. you know, there's a lot of the, you know, like the jve and these other red lights that are out there, cozy and these other red light systems, which by the way, I don't have any financial relationship to.

1 (1h 2m 12s):
Hmm. you know, the idea that red light could somehow enhance different functions of our tissues or preserve different functions of our tissues. People think it's really biohacking, like, oh, this is, you know, people under red lights. But, you know, there was a Nobel Prize given for the use of long wavelength light for the treatment of lupus, like almost a hundred years ago. So the idea of phototherapy is not the new concept, but people love to, to kind of push it into the realm of, of biohacking slash bro science. But it's not red light therapy has been shown to have some positive outcomes for the treatment of acne, for scar healing and wound healing. Red light is long wavelength light, which can penetrate further through tissues than short wavelength lights.

1 (1h 2m 56s):
So that's sort of the argument there is that when you look at red light or red, red light is placed on, or is shown on the skin. Some of it is actually getting into the deeper layers of the dermis. How deep it's questionable. Some people argue they can even get into the, the blood supply if, you know, it's like on the wrist or so in any event, Glen's lab is shown two really important findings. And the first one they've shown twice in separate studies. And this is all in humans. The first result is that if people look at red light for two or three minutes, once or twice a week, in particular early in the day, it can offset some age-related vision loss. How well the photoreceptors at the back of the eye are some of the most metabolically de consuming, metabolically active and let's just say energy consuming cells of the entire nervous system, which is saying a lot because the nervous system is the most metabolically cons consuming or metabolically, excuse me, active organ.

1 (1h 3m 48s):
And so as a consequence, these really active cells create a lot of, so-called reactive oxygen species. And that Impacts the negatively Impacts the functions of mitochondria. So viewing red light seems to restore some of the mitochondrial function by limiting reactive oxygen species in the photoreceptors and offsetting. And they've shown this some, not all, but some age-related vision loss. Presumably

0 (1h 4m 8s):
You're not talking about looking at one of these red light panels because these things are like a, a fucking, like flat. It's like, it's huge. It's so

1 (1h 4m 16s):
Bright. I'm, I actually am referring to that. Wow. but you wanna do it at a distance that's comfortable. So several feet, right. Those

0 (1h 4m 22s):
Panels for the people that don't know these things very bright, are inside. They even provide you with like high protection. Yeah. The, like, the stuff for the, for the sunbed. That's right. That goes with them.

1 (1h 4m 32s):
Yeah. So you don't wanna do this for more than a couple of minutes. And you do want to blink and you do, and probably through eye eyelids closed, if your eyelids are thin enough and it's bright enough, it can probably get in nonetheless. But let, let me very, very clear. Well, I'll tell you the other result then I'll tell you why you don't need necessarily need a red light. The other result, which is more recent and is still under review, so I wanna be very clear, but the, the data look interesting to say the least, is that there's this old theory, like old theory, that the French have really expounded that, you know, eating food outdoors is metabolized differently than eating food indoors. Which sounds crazy, right? I mean, at some level. And yet this study shows that if people do this red light viewing while eating, or in the minutes just after eating for just a few minutes, that the post-meal blood glucose level severe is significantly dampened.

1 (1h 5m 22s):
Which is a good thing, right? You don't want big elevations in blood glucose or excessive elevations in blood glucose. Now that all sounds a little bit at the edge of what we consider, you know, valid or reasonable. And yet, if you think about sunlight, sunlight is full spectrum light. So this isn't saying you need to run out and buy a red light. This is if you get outside and get your morning sunlight, yes, it's gonna set your circadian rhythm for elevated mood focus and alertness during the day, improve sleep at night. But in addition to that, you're getting red light to your eyes early in the day. Mm. You, you absolutely are getting red light to your eyes. Now in very densely overcast days, say in the UK or elsewhere, it's not, you're gonna really filter out the, the clouds are gonna filter out the red light,

0 (1h 6m 5s):
Everything, the joy, the the will to live.

1 (1h 6m 8s):
And, and as a consequence, some people choose to supplement their light with these red light devices. But this idea that the French and others have have argued, and I'm sure as I say the French said it, then, you know, the French will nod and everyone else will say, no, it, it's Like. it was us first, or us also. It's probably multiple people throughout history groups throughout history. but it does seem that there's something different about the way that food is metabolized if under different lighting conditions. Which sounds crazy. And I, I can already hear Lane Norton stomping in with his, you know, ba basically Yeah. Lane's, Lane's brain sort of has like PubMed ideas. I I I think it's great by the way, lane, we love you and I love his, his his sort of adherence to PubMed IDs.

1 (1h 6m 52s):
But you know, these are published studies I'll send along. You can tell me what you think lane. But the point being that there still needs to be more work on this. Right? But it's always nice when some nicely controlled studies done by, well-established laboratories that people in a field trust like Glen's lab start seeing things once or twice over in multiple studies that really work well with what we know from kind of naturalistic conditions. For instance, they're hunters, people that are adventurers that are whose job depends on them being able to see into the distance. Cameron

0 (1h 7m 26s):
Haines.

1 (1h 7m 27s):
Yeah. Cam Haynes. These people maintain vision well into their older age. Nerd just means mean nerds like me who spend too much time in front of a book or a screen who spend most of their time and have for many years looking at things down. I mean, for years I looked at things down a microscope, that was where most of my life was down, looking down the microscope. Wow. But also reading things at close distance. Well, you know, it makes sense that the eyeball would lengthen. You end up with nearsightedness. I do wear corrective lenses at night, especially if I'm driving at night. I've really worked hard to try to not succumb to the need for corrective lenses because I'm trying to keep my vision health good. Because you

0 (1h 8m 2s):
Become reliant.

1 (1h 8m 3s):
I don't wanna become reliant on it, but, but you know, at night I have to wear corrective lenses. Yeah.

0 (1h 8m 7s):
Talking about the red light stuff. Have you heard of Huberman Husbands? Do you know what this is?

1 (1h 8m 12s):
Yeah, unfortunately. Well, I I should say that the, the most unfortunate thing about the humor room and the Husbands post is that it was about, is that it was taken by certain media outlets to amplify the idea that the audience of my podcast is just male. When in fact it's 50% male female, at least in the listenership YouTube skews male. But we knew that anyway. But the listenership is 50% male, 50% female. And the Huberman Husbands thing was really about how a woman was saying that she thinks she's the huberman husband because she does all these different things that, but

0 (1h 8m 46s):
They got taken from that. For the people that don't know that the meta meme around Huberman Husbands, right, which you can search on TikTok right now, is that the hot new thing that all of the wives want out? There is a husband who's into red light therapy. Oh. And he does cold plunges and he does sauna treatments and stuff. So I, I wondered, see guys,

1 (1h 9m 7s):
I'm trying to help you out. Look dude,

0 (1h 9m 8s):
I, I wondered how you feel of a bunch of guys potentially cosplaying as Andrew huberman in the bedroom. Like the price of long sleeve black shirts has gone through the roof. Okay? This is, you now have people fully lopping as you, maybe they're, they're telling the, telling their wife that they didn't get enough sunlight in their eyes as dirty talk in the bedroom. I'm not sure. I wondered how it feels to have this army of Andrew huberman from wish now existing on, on the internet.

1 (1h 9m 33s):
So, so we covered the AM ccc, it means anterior mid cingulate cortex. But I confess, even though I know that I don't know what cosplay is and I don't know what LARPing is,

0 (1h 9m 44s):
Cosplay is dressing up. It's, it happens at a lot of conventions. Someone will go as Anakin Skywalker or Pikachu or whatever. And LARPing is life for,

1 (1h 9m 53s):
For sexual titillation

0 (1h 9m 54s):
Sometimes, but not always titillation.

1 (1h 9m 57s):
So this is sort of like a, this is the, this is like the action hero variation on furries

0 (1h 10m 3s):
Kind of. Yeah. Okay. but it's not,

1 (1h 10m 4s):
Furries is more Lexi domain.

0 (1h 10m 6s):
Precisely. Yeah. We know, we know that. Well, and then lopping is, well we

1 (1h 10m 9s):
Know that, but we don't know it. Well fortunately,

0 (1h 10m 11s):
Live action role playing lopping. So that again, is this kind of, I'm saying there are potentially, there is potentially a market out there if a guy is struggling in the dating world to take the aesthetic, get fully huberman pilled, and then there is a, a, a huge potential demand amongst the wives out there.

1 (1h 10m 34s):
Okay. So this is news to me. One thing that's come up recently in discussions with some traditional media outlets, but but also just generally right? Is, you know, to what extent is all this focus on health, you know, does that change something about masculine feminine dynamics? Like it like the, the traditional stereotype of men was that they're tough enough to not need to engage in any self-care, right? They don't need sleep. They can drink a lot of liquor. They'll eat when there's food, they'll eat whatever they don't like going to the doctor, right? This is, this is like, runs very countercurrent to the kinds of things I talk about in my podcast. Like, Hey, get up in the morning, get some sunlight, right?

1 (1h 11m 14s):
Lift weights, run. And I should point out that none, none of what I've talked about with exercise ever, of course there's an aesthetic component, right? Li limiting body fat to some extent, right? Not having excessive body fat, you know, resistance training as we know is an incredible way to adjust this one's aesthetics if they feel like their proportions aren't where they want, or you know, by the way, guys train your neck clearly Chris does. I mean, nothing looks more ridiculous than like wide shoulder.

0 (1h 11m 42s):
They guide tiny neck and a

1 (1h 11m 43s):
Little in a head with a little neck, pencil neck. I mean it's, well it's just, it's crazy 'cause it is proportionally you see it and you're like, this is, it's

0 (1h 11m 50s):
It's the, it's the male equivalent of the BBL. If you have like a, I'm teaching you, I'm so happy that I get to teach you about,

1 (1h 11m 57s):
This is sort of like class for me. I've

0 (1h 11m 59s):
Good to make sure you've got your notes. So this is the Brazilian butt lift. It's kind of like the bum equivalent of a boob job. And, they have an

1 (1h 12m 6s):
Implants for the glutes.

0 (1h 12m 8s):
I think that they actually take fat from elsewhere in the body and then put it into the bo It's the risk, the surgery risk of this is really quite high.

1 (1h 12m 16s):
Let me just do like hip thrusters or something. No, no, no. Isn't there that there's, that

0 (1h 12m 20s):
Takes too long.

1 (1h 12m 20s):
There's the Brett Contreras glute guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's very popular because he, he puts glutes on people, but, but they actually put them on themselves 'cause they're the ones doing the work.

0 (1h 12m 28s):
I think the doctor technically puts it on them. But yeah. And it kind of looks, because there's no associated leg development with the glute development. It's kind of like if you put two basketballs on upturned baseball bats, so you have like a, the leg and then you have like the ridiculous, it's, I've seen some, I went to Miami for the first time a few months ago and I saw one that kind of terrified me. It looked like a bag of cats from behind in a set of leggings. you know, like you could kind of see sort of paws coming out like this. It moves pulley poorly finished. I would say the implant

1 (1h 13m 1s):
Moves.

0 (1h 13m 1s):
I just, it wasn't, wasn't good anyway. My point being neck for guys need to have it proportional to the shoulders. Yeah.

1 (1h 13m 8s):
It, I mean, yeah. So I'm sort of taking digs at people that don't train their neck. It's also life insurance, right? I had an accident a few years ago where I fell off a second story roof and I walked away from it because I've long done neck training because I injured my neck when I was younger. And even if you don't do fight sports, I don't do fight sports, but wouldn't be aligned with my, my role. Yeah, yeah. In needing my brain. And I got nothing against people that do fight sports, but it, that's a choice that I've, I've actively made not to do them anymore. But neck training is, is really important for just what's,

0 (1h 13m 41s):
What's the 80 20 of neck training? What, what are the biggest movers for improving your neck? Oh,

1 (1h 13m 45s):
Well first of all, I'll, I'll tell you in a moment, but I think that, you know, remember that your neck is your upper spine. So people are big on training their abs, you know, for, for spine stability and lower back hopefully as well for spine stability, the midthoracic regions as well. But you know, it's your upper spine and, and you want it strong and you, you'll get much stronger in other things as well. Everything's better. People's posture is far better when they train their neck. It actually changes the, the tone of people's voice. And I had a guest on my podcast, Dr. Eddie Chang, who's our chair of neurosurgery at UCSF. I've known him since we were kids. He's a phenomenally smart and and creative guy. And I've asked him about this offline. you know, why is it that neck training does that? Well, you know, the voice change that occurs in boys when they, when they develop and go through puberty is a thickening of the vocal cords that's androgen dependent.

1 (1h 14m 32s):
I have this weird mutation, I've talked about this a little bit, but maybe not that on a program as broad as this, that actually I have the same voice I always had from when I was a little kid. My voice never actually changed. I have a, so I have an androgen receptor alteration. Okay? So fortunately for me Like, it doesn't cause any other issues. But this was my voice when I was five years old. How terrifying. Yeah. They call me froggy. Yeah, it was kind of a joke. I go like the kid on the little rascals that was froggy in any case. But for most people they hit puberty and then their voice changes 'cause of the thickening of the vocal cords. But obviously I had some early androgen exposure that was clear. 'cause I also had hair on my atos apple when I was like four years old. So there was some early androgen exposure.

1 (1h 15m 13s):
You're not gonna fuck with that four year old. No. Well, you know, I was a, I was a kind kid un until I was a teenager and then I eventually angry teenager, you know, I went through it. But you know, I was mo I was kind nonetheless. But in any event, when you train your neck, actually it, it does improve posture and it actually changes the timur of your voice somewhat. But for the people who speak a lot for a living, podcasters, singers, actors, et cetera, lawyers and lawyers seem to talk a lot. You don't want to do a lot of really heavy neck training because it actually changes the way that your jaw moves and the way that you speak. And you know, you and I especially like my solo Podcasts sometimes take me 11 hours to record.

1 (1h 15m 53s):
And so you wanna maintain healthy airflow through, through this region, right? But the best way to develop a strong neck safely is to unfortunately stay away from bridges, which, you know, wrestling coaches love to give you can, the, the discs can can be inj. You can, you can cause dysfunction of the discs and then the pain comes on in a moment and then you're, you're, you're hose best thing to do is take a plate and start really light, lie on a bench, stabilize yourself by putting one arm down. Okay? So you want to close the chain, so to speak. If you can get a, a foot down as well and then put that plate, you know, probably start with a five or a 10 pound plate wrapped in a towel so you don't end up with an imprint of the five or 10 on the side of your head or face.

1 (1h 16m 33s):
And then you're, you're just gonna go from neutral position, which is your head, you know, essentially straight up and down. But you're lying on your side to just, you know, about maybe 30 or 45 degrees. You don't have to like really cinch into it. And you want to keep, this is important. Keep your tongue on the roof of your mouth, your jaw shut so that your jaw are moving around. Because some people do neck work and then they'll get clicking of the jaw, they'll get pain in the ear. There's, I've spent a lot of time with skulls and I can tell you human skulls and other skulls by virtue of my work in neuroscience and dissecting stuff. And I have kind of obsession with cranial facial stuff as well. And you know, there's a lot of musculature and ligaments of the, the skull that have to be contended with so tongue on the roof of your mouth and you're just gonna, you know, nasal breathe and you're not going to failure, you're not training really heavy, higher reps in the, you know, 10 to 25 repetition range.

1 (1h 17m 19s):
Three sets. Three sets, yeah. Three sets and then the other side. Yep. And then, you know, rather than doing a lot of forward network, which people are already doing, 'cause they're doing a lot of phone reading and shaping themselves like AC you wanna lie on your stomach and put a plate on the back of your head and get into that, you know, the, the neck extension straight back. Okay. But not pinching a wrench in your head. Back movements like where you're creating some torsion up into the sides, like this is a little more dangerous. I don't recommend the person who has great tutorials on this and many other things as well as Jeff Cavalier, athlete X has a great neck tutorial that you could link to. That's where I learned it over time. I worked up from a 10 pound plate. So I, I can do five or six reps on each side with a 45 pound plate.

0 (1h 17m 56s):
But you kidding me? No, you put a 45, that's 20 kilos for the Anglicans listening. Yeah.

1 (1h 18m 1s):
So I'll do that. And I don't say that to be tough or anything, but the, the idea for me is to just have a really strong neck so that also for pressing movements and pulling movements, you'll get much stronger there.

0 (1h 18m 11s):
Well, listen, the bar has now been set for fledgling Huberman Husbands out there. They know that the neck training is a important part. Black shirt neck training, bit of a beard. Well,

1 (1h 18m 24s):
Well the, the black train, well, to be clear and women should probably train their neck as well, but lighter. Yeah. you know, for aesthetic reasons and if they want to have a bigger neck, they can do that. But I think most women don't want their neck. This is one muscle area group that does tend to grow pretty quickly. Is that right? It does. It does. And and then the other thing, and this looks ridiculous, but that Bo fighters know is very useful is that there's the kiss the sky thing where they'll actually look up and, you know, and you'll feel it in the deeper muscles of the neck. Wow. So that kind of thing is, again, you know, some people use a towel for this stuff if they don't have access to weights, but neck work is really key. Just like ab work is key. Just like lower back work is key. Just like tib work is key knees over toes guy, you know, love his content.

1 (1h 19m 4s):
Ben's amazing. So these smaller muscle groups are not gonna be the mainstay of any workout. But they become so important when you're thinking about longevity because they are the muscle groups that tend to, cause if not trained shin splints, kink in the neck, the, the kink in the neck is obviously as not a technical term, but pain in the neck, the turning in the shower after doing heavy pressing and then like you're out your neck, you can't turn your head. Yeah. The lower back pain, sciatica, often lower spine stabilization issues. I, I really think Jeff Cavalier has some of the best zero cost content on this that's, I've followed his content for years and you know, if you put in for instance, sciatica, low back pain, he has diagnostic tools there that really help you establish whether or not it's truly lower back pain or it's a medial glute issue and gives you the proper things to do.

1 (1h 19m 51s):
And neck is just one piece of the equation. Getting back to Huberman Husbands, the, yeah, I chuckled the first time I saw it. I, I think it was a little frustrating to me because I thought, wait, there are a lot of women that do these protocols too. Our protocols are mo we have had some male hormone health episodes, some female hormone health episodes, but in general we're just talking about stuff that's applicable to everybody. But listen, I don't control the internet. I don't make the rules out there. And you know, and then traditional media amplified the Huberman Husbands piece through a couple of article articles,

0 (1h 20m 22s):
So rightly

1 (1h 20m 23s):
So. And the next thing you know that, that's where the black shirt I should just say is because I try and as we've talked about before, I don't want my tattoos to distract and I got a lot of them. I wanna focus on content and teaching and people hearing the content and, and the black shirt is something I did long before I had a podcast. And that's 'cause the great Joe Strummer singer for the Clash Mescaleros wore a black button down shirt while he would do full shows and he would be soaking wet. It was like the punkt thing I ever saw. Yeah. That he was like doing full shows, like belting it out and playing long sleeve show in long sleeve black shirt. And he was just literally, the shirt was like stuck to his body. And I was just saying like, not only is he an amazing humanitarian writer, poet singer for the Clash Creative miss him, he's gone, but he's still hear it through music right?

1 (1h 21m 7s):
As they say. And he, you know, he's just so punk. He's just up there in his forties or late forties and and soaking wet. And I'm thinking like that guy, like, he's got, he's got it figured out. I'm gonna do

0 (1h 21m 20s):
It, you know.

1 (1h 21m 21s):
So anyway. And I like the black shirt, what can I say? Well get

1 (1h 22m 32s):
How concerned do you think we should be about vaping spoke about alcohol? It seems like there's this big vape is on Netflix at the moment. It's a documentary about the rise of Juul and I'm only one episode in, but it seems like vaping is now catching an awful lot of attention.

0 (1h 22m 51s):
What, how concerned do you think we should be about vaping? Yeah,

1 (1h 22m 54s):
Sorry, I'm just taking a note here. I take notes during our podcast.

0 (1h 22m 59s):
Highly intense. It totally makes sense.

1 (1h 23m 3s):
Just the things I can go back to. We should be very concerned. So when it comes to smoking or vaping, there's the thing that's being consumed, the, the thing that people are trying to bring put in their bloodstream, nicotine, cannabis, et cetera. And, let, let's just set those aside. I've done episodes on nicotine and cannabis and they have their application, they also have their problems. Vaping is terrible because of the other chemicals that delivers to the lungs. It's also very clear, and we haven't released this episode yet, but I talked to a female hormone doc from Austin and Natalie Crawford. So O-B-G-Y-N you know, Vaping is associated with disruptions in egg health and what they call egg quality can create certain mutations in eggs and serious endocrine issues in women.

1 (1h 23m 48s):
Okay. Personally, I find it disgusting. Like I just find it like that. I don't do it. But when I see people vaping, like to me and listen, I used to, when growing up, I, I don't, I quit smoking a long time ago, but I used to smoke a bit of nicotine growing up. Remember I was, I was a wild one, but that's not why I did it. I just, I, you know, nicotine works for me as a drug and I don't do it anymore. But vaping is so addictive. It's a mutagen, it mutates the genes of cells. It mutates the genes of rapidly dividing cells most. So breast cancers, ovarian cancers, egg quality, you know, sperm are constantly turning over.

1 (1h 24m 28s):
So, you know, people always say no. Well, I vape all the time and I got so-and-so pregnant or whatever. you know, women will say, I have a perfectly healthy kid. That kid might have been much healthier. And also the kid's not grown up yet. Like, introduce me to the kid later. I wish for that kid. I pray for them. But that they're healthy as can be. but it is so clear that you're introducing a to a laundry list of toxins to the lungs and they're getting into the bloodstream and there are a number of them that cross the blood brainin barrier. And once they cross the blood brain barrier those neurons by virtue of the fact that neurons don't turn over across the lifespan you're born with, the ones that you're gonna die with. You might add a few across your lifespan, but you're mostly born with the ones that you're gonna die with. Well, they're gonna harbor those chemicals and those particulates and you know, yes, our, we have grandparents that smoked and live to be 90, but you know, those are generally the outliers.

1 (1h 25m 15s):
So I, I can't find one good reason why people should vape if they, if people want nicotine in their system that badly and here I'm not recommending that they would be much better off relying on at ROC or a patch. Yep. Because they know whatever, or even toothpicks or, or you know, or injectable. I know people, I'm not gonna out inject nicotine. Oh, I'm not gonna out anyone here, but I, I know people in our podcast community that rely on nicotine injections for, fuck that mental clarity that is so hardcore. Yeah, I don't, it, it causes elevation in blood pressure, it causes vasoconstriction, but it also will robustly increase focus and attention as any smoker. What will tell you name lining nicotine my vein. Yeah.

1 (1h 25m 55s):
You're starting to see some companies that offer things like NAD infusions al also offer subcutaneous or or nicotine injections. Interesting. Going back to the or patch or gum. Yeah.

0 (1h 26m 5s):
Smoking for a very long time. Everyone knows huge campaign, which I think was pretty effective actually. It's kind of discouraging people from smoking or at least making them aware about the,

1 (1h 26m 15s):
Do you, do you remember how they got kids to stop smoking? They told them for years it was bad for their health. That didn't work. They told them that it was putting money in the pockets of these like, of like these old cackling white guys that were like rubbing their hands in, in the, in the boardroom making a ton of money. And then it became the rebellious thing to quit smoking. That was the effective campaign.

0 (1h 26m 40s):
So I, I think about this all the time that there was a big push to both disincentivize and make more different smoke, make more difficult smoking. You gotta go outside. There's the smoking area. I remember I worked in clubs for one year before the smoking ban came in. Yeah, in the uk. Yeah. And then people had to go outside, you know, just friction, friction, friction all the way down. And then vaping came in and vaping is way more enjoyable of an experience than smoking ever was. You, you can have a higher dose of nicotine that tastes, you know, enjoyable bubblegum flavor and raspberry unicorn dust and whatever, whatever. Pretty unicorn. I don't know. And it's not gonna stink the house out.

0 (1h 27m 21s):
you know, you, you don't have any of the externalities of that. So I wonder whether we have ended up in a net benefit or net cost for public health from switching from smoking to Vaping.

1 (1h 27m 35s):
Yeah, there's an analog here with, you know, credo and opioids. Dude, you know, if you really want to, we just gotta put ourselves under attack by even bringing it up the topic. But I did it intentionally. you know, there are things like smoking and opioid Addiction, which are, it's unequivocal, it's just terrible. Right? It crushes lives, his lives. Yes. There are those rare individuals who smoke their whole life, lived into their nineties and okay. But they are outliers. So the question is, did is vaping allowing fewer people to smoke and therefore improving their health? Maybe if they're hell bent on getting that nicotine or cannabis into their system and they're opting not to smoke and they're gonna vape instead, then maybe we have to be objective and say, okay, if there are absolutely intent on, on getting it in through some inhalation device.

1 (1h 28m 27s):
Mm, Vaping is probably better. But we don't know that for sure. We actually don't know that. And then since I brought it up, and I really put the target on myself with this one, you know, I, I did a post about Kratom, which is over the counter, people will say it's not an opioid. It taps the opioid system, it taps other systems as well. And a number of people have indeed managed to get themselves off of opioids using Kratom as a bit of a bridge. Kinda like the methadone heroine thing. But the kram advocacy groups are really growing strong right now because there is the possibility that Kratom will be made illegal in the not too distant future. And there is the reality that some people who were never opioid addicts have taken Kratom and then get addicted to Kratom and then people start arguing, is it real Addiction?

1 (1h 29m 14s):
Is it habit forming? Et cetera. So I think the next year or so is gonna be an interesting time for dialogue about Kratom. I have a couple of guests coming on my podcast, maybe you'll do it as well. And I'd love that if you would. There's one thing, by the way folks that's so great about the podcast space, unlike other professions, we love it when one topic or one guest shows up on multiple Podcasts because it, it actually doesn't hurt any of us. And you've

0 (1h 29m 34s):
Sent me in the last few months, you sent me Paul Conte, you've sent me Rick Rubin. It's, and everyone's got a different flex, right? The conversation you are going to have with Rick or Paul is gonna be way different to the one that I'm gonna have, which is gonna be way different to the one that Joe's gonna have. Yeah.

1 (1h 29m 47s):
It's a, it's a, it's a very different thing than academic science, than journalism of other kinds. Zero sum the idea. It's a, it's a no scoop. The they, you know, like in academia or in or in journalism, they say, oh, you know, who got the scoop? you know, or you got scooped, someone else put it out first and you know, in, in, in podcasting it's, it's quite the opposite. So I think the kramm versus, I mean the kramm topics can be really interesting and important to cover. But I think, look, my vote is to not vape. I think I'm just shocked at how many people vape. And first of all, it, it's actually bec not unlike cigarette smoking, it's expensive. That's not the main reason people avoid it, but it, it's a significant expense when you add it up across the year.

1 (1h 30m 30s):
It's clearly addictive. There's no question about it. It's clearly detrimental to lung function. And then people like how it makes their brain feel And, they think that if they're already pretty active, physically active, then they can offset some of that And. they probably can. But I think in the next five years or so, we're just gonna see a slew of studies showing that vaping is just bad for us, especially for the developing brain because it's bringing in at a very rapid rate, high potency nicotine and high potency cannabis. And you know, from mono LE's work. And we know my colleague at Stanford that that the, the slope of that increase in dopamine and epinephrine, adrenaline and acetylcholine is so important. The sharper that slope, the faster the rise, the more addictive potential these compounds have.

1 (1h 31m 13s):
And so it's so far and away different than the kind of dopamine or epinephrine or acetylcholine increase that one sees with exercise or with cold plunges or with with sex or with these other things. Dancing with friends or dancing or things, you know. So, and you know, one of course could be addicted to any of the other things I just mentioned too, but the, the potential for it is, is far less than something like Vaping.

0 (1h 31m 33s):
Here's my stance on it that I, I understand maybe of the two evils Vaping is less of an evil than traditional smoking would be. Yeah. But I think the enjoyability, the accessibility, the fact that it isn't as stigmatized, all of that, I think that it wouldn't surprise me if more people are now going to vape than ever previously smoked. And ah, it, even if the difference between the two is, is that vaping is better that the total area under the curve of public health degradation. Right. I think that, I think that we've netted a loss overall for vaping. And you know, I see dude, I I I go to a comedy show and I find myself going and getting an ESCO bar before and I'm like, what? Like why is it, it's just habit.

0 (1h 32m 13s):
What is it? It's like a, like a, just a disposable vape. So

1 (1h 32m 16s):
Do you vape?

0 (1h 32m 17s):
I do it if I go to a comedy show and I'm not drinking and I'm tired, so there's like a certain little decision tree that I go through. I'll do it maybe once a month, something like that. That what

1 (1h 32m 27s):
What do you vape?

0 (1h 32m 28s):
Whatever, whatever disposable, unpronounceable horse shit is available. Whatever's in my friend. but

1 (1h 32m 34s):
It nicotine or cannabis nicotine, nicotine. Yeah. We're in California so people talk about cannabis

0 (1h 32m 39s):
In Texas.

1 (1h 32m 39s):
Texas. Interesting. Yeah, I think rapid onset of these neuromodulators in the brain concerns me. It's just, it's just so different Also with, with behaviors you can titrate. Right? you know, people say, well, video games cause a huge increase in doning around, okay fine. but you can limit the total amount of time that you engage you. I think with, with substances, even though you can control dose or number of, of, what do they call it on the, it's not gonna be like a toke on the vape pen. What is, it's gonna be like a, like a draw.

0 (1h 33m 13s):
I dunno, I didn't know the language. Vaping,

1 (1h 33m 14s):
LARPing, cosplay. I've got that. you know

0 (1h 33m 16s):
Where good. I'm teaching you everything today.

1 (1h 33m 18s):
Everything I need to know. This is good because I'm gonna be able to navigate the internet. Fantastic.

0 (1h 33m 21s):
Far better. Fantastic. Talking about the internet, how worried are you about how technology is impacting people's ability to focus

1 (1h 33m 29s):
Adult ADHD is clearly upon us, it's just clear and so very, I'm I'm very concerned

0 (1h 33m 36s):
You think that that's induced or or facilitated or worsened by technology? Yeah. Like tell me, tell me what's going on in the brain if, how is technology able to make such a, a dramatic change? Yeah,

1 (1h 33m 45s):
I think if we, let's turn it on its head. I'm not changing your question 'cause I don't Like it. When people do that to me,

0 (1h 33m 50s):
Answer what you want,

1 (1h 33m 51s):
Show, show. Sometimes I'll ask a question on my podcast and people will flip and they're like, I'm gonna give you a different question. Answer that one. And I was like, okay, like, I'm gonna answer your question a different way. The, the circuits in the brain that are required for setting and maintaining focus are inhibited by the process of deliberately shifting one's focus over and over and over throughout the day. In other words, if ever there was a physical activity that could undermine your cardiovascular exercise, you know, like, I mean it turns out not to be the case, but you know, there was this idea a few years ago that if you sit a lot during the day, it doesn't matter how much you exercise, it's not gonna make a difference. That's not true.

1 (1h 34m 32s):
Right. Exercise still helps. But we also know that moving and standing, standing and sit, you know, standing up and sitting down quite a lot throughout the day, getting as much, you know, little walks and things like that is extremely beneficial and can amplify the already known positive effects of exercise. Okay. Well when it comes to focus, I mean much of what our schooling is about growing up is not just the content that we're taught, but our ability to sit still and pay attention to keep the body still and to focus to some extent. Keep the body still some people gesticulate more of the Italians and the, you know, in certain Arab countries and things like that. Yeah. And other people are far more still. And we get back to this about body stillness a little bit later 'cause there's some emerging ideas on that that are worth touching on.

1 (1h 35m 13s):
But the point is that if one is constantly moving their attention from one thing to the next, it undermines the stability of all the circuitry in the brain that's responsible for prolonged focus. Now I partake in social media, so do you, but the scroll function is a practice of shifting focus while maintaining gaze in one location. Right. Normally we would shift focus by looking here, by looking there. I mean, just for, try this for 30 minutes tomorrow, folks listening to this. Take 30 minutes of your day and decide you're, that you're only going to exist in the three dimensional world. Meaning you're not gonna look at screens for 30 minutes.

1 (1h 35m 53s):
Okay. Obviously screens your phone has a depth to it, but you know what I'm talking about. You'll notice that your attention is shifting all the time. You're looking at a brick wall, then there's this, then there's you. But, but it's all harnessed by some sort of conceptual goal or physical goal. Trying to get here, finish a conversation, complete an answer to a question. That's all within a tunnel of, of, of motivation when you're on your phone and scrolling. And I think scrolling itself is the major issue. When you're scrolling, you're essentially putting yourself into new context after new context, after new context. And the brain has to adjust to all of that. And the way that the brain works in addition to controlling heartbeat and autonomic function, et cetera, is, think about it sort of like a, like a, i, I don't want to diss it, but I went, I took my si sister to see the Harry Potter play recently in New York.

1 (1h 36m 44s):
And while I wasn't a big fan of the, the script at all,

0 (1h 36m 47s):
Was this the Half-blood something? What was it

1 (1h 36m 51s):
Called? Yeah, it was the, the, what is it? The, like the cursed child one?

0 (1h 36m 54s):
Cursed, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Me, me. Jordan Peterson and Douglas Murray got thrown out. Neely got thrown out of that during Covid. I've gotta tell you the story, once you're done, it's one of the phenomenal thing that I saw. So you went to go and see it too?

1 (1h 37m 6s):
Okay. I took, my sister likes theater and we go to New York each year for her birthday. And I took her to this show, and I wasn't a big fan of the script, to be honest. I only read one of the Harry Potter books, liked it, but then abandoned it. But she, she really likes the Harry Potter stories. I wasn't a fan of the script, that's just my uninformed opinion, but the effects were spectacular. Okay. And one of the things that occurred to me, they had this library there where the books are alive. And as I was watching this, I realized that that's very much how the brain works. That, for instance, when you walk into a room, it's a new context. And it would be the same as if you were walking through a library.

1 (1h 37m 45s):
And let's say you, you go to a soccer European football game and you sit down and all of a sudden the, your brain calls up all these books about European soccer, and your favorite team is right there. And then you open that, and then all of a sudden you're looking at that. Something about your favorite team. What's your favorite team? Newcastle. Newcastle, okay. And then with unbeknownst to you, unbeknownst to you, this is the important part, the books all around you, not the one you're looking at, are now changing to the competitors and the history of that team. But also, who's the, the directly antagonistic rival team? Sunderland,

0 (1h 38m 18s):
Sun, Sunderland.

1 (1h 38m 19s):
Sunderland. Okay.

0 (1h 38m 20s):
Sunderland. Yeah. There it is, baby. Okay.

1 (1h 38m 22s):
So that's the way the brain works. It's calling up context so that it makes it very easy to fl to a discussion about a particular rivalry in a particular year, in a particular match, in a particular point in player. That's focus. Focus is not about maintaining a single tunnel of cognition. Focus is about calling to mind all these additional contextually relevant batches of information that you might need. And you know, the reason I, the analogy of the Harry Potter Library is that it's a dynamic library. So the moment we're done here and we walk out, yes. Some of the, the books, so to speak, of the, of this conversation will linger with us. But whatever we're focused on next, whatever goal directed behavior we have, making it to dinner or through traffic or wherever we're going, will call up a new library.

1 (1h 39m 10s):
Now, some people might say, well, dove, of course it works that way, but it's not Dove because it's very dynamic now. Social media is the opposite of that. It's one library, next account, another library, next account, another library, next account, another library, another library, another library. And the brain is calling up all these different libraries in rapid succession. Wow. So when I look, like, I'll be honest, the, the selected choice of things to click on tells me a lot about what I've been clicking on. Right. That, I mean, obviously the algorithm is telling me to train yourself. Yeah. I confess, and I'm really embarrassed to say, but not so embarrassed that I won't reveal that. What I find now on that gallery of things to select are street fights.

1 (1h 39m 50s):
So beat downs. Yep. And really adorable strange animals or cute animals. I love the flora and fauna life. The

0 (1h 39m 57s):
Duality of Andrew Huberman. Yeah.

1 (1h 39m 59s):
Right. And not the Capy bar. Like if ever there was an uninteresting animal, it's the Capy bar. However, yes, the raccoon accounts are delightful to me. The the, the nature is metal account is very cool. Phenomenal. Cool. Yeah. There's an extensive community of capi bar enthusiasts on Instagram,

0 (1h 40m 18s):
Which you're a member of. No,

1 (1h 40m 19s):
I I've actively avoided capar accounts. You're a

0 (1h 40m 22s):
Big octopus guy

1 (1h 40m 23s):
Though. I like cephalopods. I like cuttlefish. My lab used to work on cuttlefish and octopuses. Octopi

0 (1h 40m 30s):
Andrew. Come on

1 (1h 40m 31s):
It, it octopuses. It's octopuses.

0 (1h 40m 34s):
I've been taught for so long that it's

1 (1h 40m 35s):
Octopus octopuses. And, and actually this is

0 (1h 40m 37s):
The most, hang on, this is the most,

1 (1h 40m 38s):
Is gonna kill me because there was a meme about this because we did a live, okay, so I know too much about this. 'cause I used to, my lab used to work on cephalopods, which are one, they're, which are the category of mollusks include cuttlefish and octopuses. And so it's octopuses is the correct, plural and more.

0 (1h 40m 57s):
This is the most, this is the most like, groundbreaking piece of information that we've got so far today.

1 (1h 41m 1s):
Moreover, the great Oliver Sacks, who's now unfortunately dead, is a, a neurologist and popular writer about the brain function, the man who mistook his wife has had, et cetera. He, a real hero of mine, talked about this, that, you know, it's also platypus. And that he wrote about, you can look this up. He wrote about traveling to Australia and then going to the far north where they have a breeding program to reestablish the platypus. And that the location of the bleeding, the breeding program, excuse me, is literally the Platy pussy.

0 (1h 41m 37s):
Wow. Yeah,

1 (1h 41m 38s):
Yeah. Oliver Sacks wrote about this. So I've long been interested in the platypus as an interesting animal. They're very interesting. And the

0 (1h 41m 45s):
Octopi octopus

1 (1h 41m 46s):
Octopuses. Yep. Yeah, that's okay. you know, many

0 (1h 41m 49s):
Occupied i'll that it's, it's a

1 (1h 41m 51s):
Revolution. So does that mean that the plural is the of or that the location where they breed octopuses is the octopussy?

0 (1h 41m 58s):
I hope so. Okay. I want to go there. Yeah.

1 (1h 41m 60s):
Well, according to Oliver Sachs, this is the correct nomenclature, and he's the neurologist expert in Cephalopods So. we can return to this at some point. I wanna show you, I'm sure people will put in the comments where we're right, where we're wrong. I'm absolutely so, but either way, they will have gone out and researched and learned. And that's what the, that's what

0 (1h 42m 16s):
We're here for. That's what we're for. I wanna show you, I wanna show you this video. We can put it up on the screen. Just press play on the middle of that. Okay. And And, let me know what you think.

1 (1h 42m 25s):
Right? So the, for those listening who aren't watching, this is an image of a kid flipping back and forth between a iPad and a phone with incredible dexterity. This is a family out to dinner and the kids are watching screens. There's another kid without any phone in his hands, crying, attempting to swipe the phone that is not in his hand, as if, as if scratching at a a, an itch, but not successfully. And a kid actually tapping a screen in their sleep. Yeah. Yes, there's indeed. We are in the thank you.

0 (1h 43m 3s):
What do you think's going on there?

1 (1h 43m 5s):
Yeah. And thanks for getting me outta the animal fights conversation. The what's happening is very clear, which is that, you know, the brain, the human brain is an incredible organ because it's a map of our experience. It has certain parts that are hardwired that govern our heart rate and control of our heart rate or control of our breathing, immune, certain immune functions and on and on. But then a vast percentage of our, of the human brain is, is open real estate that is designated as one function or another, depending on what happens to you during development.

1 (1h 43m 46s):
So we know this for sure, my scientific great-grandparents won the Nobel Prize for this David hug and Torrance and Weasel, that what you see during development, really between the ages of birth and about age 14 mainly. But certainly extending longer creates a set of modules or maps within the brain that allow you to predict what's gonna happen in the future. So if kids are growing up doing a lot of swiping behavior, this, remember we're in the first time in human history where people have written with their thumbs also, right? Texting, there are entirely different maps of how language is encoded motor, I should say. How motor functions and language interact, you know, in the past, meaning for tens of thousands of years, if not longer, gesticulating according, and speech and grunting and shouting and pointing is one of the primary modes of communication.

1 (1h 44m 35s):
It's not surprising, therefore, that the representation of the hands and the digits, which is a nerd speak for fingers, is right next to the areas of the brain. They're responsible for generating language and speech and language. So we now have the ability to speak with our thumbs, so, so to speak, no pun intended, by texting. We now have the ability to see many different contextual landscapes, as we talked about before, by swiping typically up, sometimes down, typically up, right? So the ups swipe has become, you know, as perhaps as hard, not as mapped into the brain as the wave.

1 (1h 45m 16s):
Hi. You say, what do you say to babies? you know, hi, people try and get their attention. Get them to go wide-eyed smile, how, you know, they do peekaboo. These guys, people have been doing this for a very long time. Now, the swipe function is one of the ways in which human beings engage in the world. It's almost, it's not as fundamental as opening one's mouth to eat, but it's pretty close. So the, the brain has just adapted to this. There's real estate set aside for whatever your experience was. And so what you're seeing there is just kids very adept at doing this because it's always a trade off hub. Diesel in part won the Nobel Prize for showing that plasticity of the brain, mapping of the brain for one particular sensory experience or function, say swiping, or the ability to switch back and forth between multiple screens is always, always at the expense of some other potential function.

1 (1h 46m 4s):
You can't do everything.

0 (1h 46m 6s):
So when children are inculcating that particular habit, there is the Thomas soul quote. Like, there are no solutions, only trade-offs. Right? Yeah. I, I think I've got written on my whiteboard on my fridge at the moment, the five most common deathbed regrets. And it's things like, I wish that I'd not worked as much. I wish I'd let myself be happy. I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends. It will be unbelievably surprising to me if in 40 years time I wish I'd spent less time on my phone isn't on there, I would bet pretty much everything that I have that, that, that would probably appear on average on people's five top death bed regrets.

0 (1h 46m 49s):
I wish I'd spent less time on my phone. And we can see this happening in front of us. And the best way that you can tell that this is going to continue to happen is that you can reflect on what you did over the last week. And one of the most common things that you wish that you'd done less of over the last week was, shouldn't I, I got, I got captured, I, I did a couple of YouTube holes or TikTok scrolls or Instagram, whatevers, and you know, that this is happening in the micro spread that across a lifetime. you know, I think that very much we're gonna look back at this and hopefully there is some kind of solution. Maybe it's Neuralink, maybe, you know, we have a way that we can kind of ethically engage with technology and get the communication and the stimulation and the exploration of different ideas and communities.

0 (1h 47m 33s):
But yeah, right now kind of feels a little bit like, maybe a little bit like when cigarettes first came out, like your doctor smokes camels, you know, like we didn't, nobody knew what the bad effects of this were. They didn't know long term what it was gonna cause. And dude, that video, I really wanted to show it to you because you taught me, I I was, I think correctly incorrectly categorizing people's phone use as an Addiction. And I think that you said it's much more like a compulsion, right? And that is a child that's asleep or nearly asleep prote like compulsively scrolling through that far. Yeah,

1 (1h 48m 12s):
Because a compulsion does not, the, an obsession is mental, this is a classic definition. A compulsion is a behavior, but the compulsion in classic OCD doesn't relieve the obsession. Yeah. It actually exacerbates it the

0 (1h 48m 31s):
Payoff. Right. Lack

1 (1h 48m 32s):
Of, so you're, you're not, it's sort of like an itch that you scratch and it just get it itches more. Right? And there is something like that with social, I don't wanna say social media, but with phone scrolling. Now that said, I mean, you know, I, you know, of my waking hours, most of it is spent foraging for organizing or dispersing information, and much of that is done on the phone or computer. Yep. But I do read books, you know, hard books. I meaning physical books. I brought you one today. thank you. I like audio books too. I, I listen to a lot of Podcasts. I watch your YouTube videos, so I learn when I'm on the internet, but yeah, occasionally it's the, you know, well I learned from Nature is metal, but occasion, but, but I haven't learned anything from the raccoon posts, nothing of substance anyway.

1 (1h 49m 20s):
Well, here's the thing, except that they're very like, they're very like cute and very,

0 (1h 49m 24s):
They do that thing when they scoop, scoop food up like this And, they,

1 (1h 49m 27s):
They wash, they wash food in my pool. Now I moved to a place, I'm renting a place that has a pool. I've never had a pool before. Okay. I've skateboarding a lot of empty pools, but I've never had one that had water in it. So And, they come through in the night, it's Raccoon Olympics in the middle of the night, and they're coming through, they make a ton of noise, and then they're washing their food and it's pretty cute the first time you see it. But once they wake you up the third or fourth time,

0 (1h 49m 46s):
Then you're damn raccoons

1 (1h 49m 47s):
You're trying to, yeah. So, you know, I haven't learned much from that from the raccoon videos. Certainly the fight videos haven't really taught me anything about self-defense or, or anything useful except how, you know, just kind of cruel people can be. So I'm trying to change the algorithm by, by clicking on other things. but it seems pretty slow to change. I,

0 (1h 50m 5s):
I gotta tell you this, it's got me on, I've never been into Star Wars. I've seen some of the movies or whatever, but I've never been into it for some reason, it started delivering me short content about Star Wars law. Like who would've won between Darth Vader and Dark Mo and all, like, who was more powerful as a Jedi master and all this stuff. Interesting. And I've never been interested in this. And yet it's created in me the desire to actually be like, well, yeah, like, would Master Yoda have won, like however many eons ago if he was at full power when the, the, the sift was, and I, I don't even know what I'm talking about, but it's like created in me this thing, the interesting thing that you're talking about there is that there's, when you're foraging, you spend enough time on the internet and you do find something that gives you that, oh wow, I never knew about that before.

0 (1h 50m 51s):
And it's that sort of needle in a haystack that you're looking through and that trigger of, wow, I found so I can talk about it on a podcast. This is really interesting to me. That is the carrot I think that gets dangled for, for very many people who want to feel better about their social media use and think, well, okay, yeah, you know, I wasted 90 minutes, but I did get that thing out of it. I read that CK post, or I, I found this new person that I really care about. you know, the variable schedule reward of intellectual satisfaction is also in there. Right? It's not just the shock. Sure. It's not just the cute Yeah.

1 (1h 51m 27s):
PubMed mode for me is that, you know, PubMed library conversation,

0 (1h 51m 30s):
The only guy

1 (1h 51m 31s):
You

0 (1h 51m 31s):
Know who thinks that PubMed variable scheduled rewards.

1 (1h 51m 34s):
I remember when PubMed first came out as as a, like a very searchable DA database. And, and some of the journals later became electronic and now they're all available electronic. And I could not believe it. I was so excited. 'cause I used to go to the library and I have to pay with, put money on the card and Xerox copy and stuff. but it also in the library, I love libraries and I'd spend so much time when I was a, a student and graduate student and you'd find something and it's like, I'd look around like, did anyone, like, did you see that? You see that? But since I was a little kid, I was discovering stuff in books and then talking about it to everybody, even if they didn't want to hear. And so I was professing from a young age in class on Mondays and things. So, so for me, it's hardwired into my system by now. And I think that I, I do think that social media holds certain gems.

1 (1h 52m 17s):
I think we're thinking about, talking about like mining for gems Yep. Yep. Of social interaction too. you know, I've gotten to know some people through social media where it's really enriched my life. I've reconnected with some people. Yep. And it's really enriched my life. It's allowed me to connect the dots going backward in ways I hadn't anticipated. And I think going forward, if you're asking about the kids in the video that you showed me, or you're talking about adults or anyone, it's the, the, the success is largely going to be determined by who has the most self-discipline. I really do. Now, it's always been the case, but I don't think it's ever been the case to the extent that it is now. So this is why I'm such a fan of taking some space from all action.

1 (1h 53m 0s):
This is actually something I learned from Rick Ruben. you know, I'm fortunate to call him a close friend. We, we communicate pretty much every day. And I went and spent a week with him abroad this summer. It was the worst time to travel. And I decided to go over to where he was in Europe and just spend the week with him. We had no plan. And first of all, on the way over there, there was nothing to watch on the plane. But there was this Tom Petty documentary and I turned it on. I'm not a huge Tom Petty fan, but it was interesting enough. And then Rick, Rick is in the documentary and he's in the documentary lying down doing the interview. Typical, like typical meaning unusual for most people. Typical 'cause it's unusual for Rick Yeah. To be lying down.

1 (1h 53m 42s):
And I thought, okay, so get there. I I know his family well and I love them. And, and it was really wonderful. It was beautiful. It's a beautiful part of Europe. But, you know, I noticed, so we had this habit of we would tread water in the pool and listen to Podcasts in the morning. And there's a wonderful podcast by the way, that we should all be aware of. I think it's a history of rock and roll in 500 songs by Andrew Hickey, super nerdy. It's like a getting a, like a graduate degree in rock and roll. It talks about the music, but also what's happening in like, organized crime, how it impacted record sales. Very contextual. Very cool. I'm very into that lately. And I'm in and in this show on Netflix, have you seen spy ops? Yes. Which is very good, right? Because it's not just like shoot 'em up type stuff. It's, it's really about how spy operations, let me put it this way, it can teach you a lot about history, international history and, and geopolitical history.

1 (1h 54m 33s):
So I go over there and we do some treading water listening to Podcasts. I learned about this history of, of rock and roll, 500 songs, Podcasts. We talk about it a little bit. And then I noticed that, you know, Rick has a practice. I hope he doesn't mind me sharing this. 'cause I'm about to, you know, Rick has a practice, he has many practices, but one of them is he'll spend a good amount of time, you know, just sitting and thinking or lying down and thinking. And I, it didn't occur to me at the time, but later after I returned, I thought back to our first guest episode of my podcast. I hosted a guy named Carl Deis Roth, who's probably the, the finest bioengineer on the planet.

1 (1h 55m 15s):
He's also a fully active clinician, psychiatrist. He's got five children. He's one of these phenoms. you know, Dick seems to be able to do everything. And he's a true genius. He went to school with medical school with Peter Att and Paul Conte. They were all in the same class. Yeah. And I know him very well. And he's a colleague of mine at Stanford. And, and everyone knows he's, he's a super, he's a super, he's like the Michael Jordan of neuroscience, except he's still active. And that is not a statement about personality, just in terms of, of successful hit rate. Carl described a practice that he does after he puts his kids to sleep of where he sits deliberately, sits completely still, and forces himself to think in complete sentences.

1 (1h 55m 57s):
And this set off an a light in my head when I realize Rick does a form of this, and Carl does a form of this. If you read the new Elon Musk book, they talk about Elon doing a form of this. The great Richard Feynman, physicist Nobel Prize winner talked about going into flotation tanks and doing a form of this. Einstein did a form of this. So what are we talking about? So I'm a neuroscientist, but I'm certainly not as smart as any of those guys. What we're talking about is body still mind active. Now I've become in increasingly curious about psychedelic therapies. One of which is, and by the way, only in a clinical context, et cetera, legality, et cetera.

1 (1h 56m 37s):
Not in kids, et cetera, but the practice is essentially macro dose psilocybin, but with the eye mask on completely, still mind very active. Okay. Contrast that to a different behavior slash protocol that I'm very familiar with, which is I like to do long runs or rucks on Sunday body. Very active mind, not directed at anything in particular. Sometimes I'll do it without a book or podcast. Sometimes I do it with a combination of both. Many people talk about swimming or in the shower or cycling, some sort of rhythmic movement drumming. The great Joe Strummer was really big on campfires. He, you know, I was gonna mention this earlier, but I'll mention it now, that as an alternative to alcohol consumption, get your friends together around a fire.

1 (1h 57m 23s):
By the way, the firelight, the light from fire does not disrupt the circadian system. This has actually been shown candlelight, moonlight, firelight as bright as it is, it's just very low luxe. So that's where great things happen, independent of alcohol, right around a campfire as it goes way back in our lineage. So there're these two states of mind and body that I find fascinating to the point of being intriguing, to the point of having modified what I do now. Because they're the, they're the inverse of one another body completely still, or close to completely still mind, very active, could be with psilocybin, but that's not the protocol I'm recommending. I'm talking about some very, very smart, extremely accomplished people who all did the same thing.

1 (1h 58m 4s):
The other is body, very active mind isn't still, but is not deliberately channeled to any particular linear kind of story or something like that. There's a state in sleep where our body is literally paralyzed and the brain is extremely active. It's called rapid eye movement sleep. So I'm sort of raising a flag for this potential protocol slash practice. I don't have any peer reviewed science to support what I'm about to say, but I have enough examples of extremely accomplished people now in front of me to realize that there's something special about divorcing mind and body function temporarily, deliberately sitting there and just thinking.

1 (1h 58m 47s):
And recently I had a conversation with the great Paul Conte and the addition of the words, the great in front of him are appropriate here he is. I I believe, based on my observation of his clinical work and and intellectual acumen, that he's the finest psychiatrist of our age, clearly integrating from so many backgrounds. He has worked with a ton of interesting people coming on the podcast in December. It's coming. Amazing. I, and he's just phenomenal, right? Not just about trauma, but about everything, personality type, narcissism, gaslighting, mean, people throw those terms around like crazy. P will tell you what it actually means. Okay? What those terms actually mean. But the ability to think and to access the unconscious. Paul refers to the unconscious as the supercomputer of the brain for the un the unconscious mind and the conscious mind are always in a dialogue.

1 (1h 59m 32s):
But here's the theory, here's the, the hypothesis that when we bring our body into states of stillness in rem sleep, in these deliberate states that I just described, that these other people actively engage in and have for a long time. That the unconscious mind can start to take over a larger percentage of that conversation. And we have access to new ideas, new ways of structuring thought, et cetera. And I don't think one requires psilocybin to do it, but I do think that is one avenue into it, reliable, that's reliable. It also carries certain hazards, right? Because it's, it's like being put on a mental rocket ship to some extent. It's not like DMT, but very little control over where one's cognition goes.

1 (2h 0m 12s):
Although there is some in there. Anyway, I just wanted to throw this up on the wall because it's always fun to talk about new things and kind of what's coming, what I think is coming next. I think if I were to make a prediction, I think in the next two years you're not just gonna hear about meditation, nons, sleep, deep rest, something. I'm a big fan of yoga nidra, hypnosis, but also whatever we want to call this, you'll probably come up with a better name than I can body still mind active states to access different aspects of our unconscious and cognition. And I must say that we do this with the phone. Sorry, I just, 'cause I realize you were about to say something and when you speak you say interesting things and I learned co play LARPing, I learned don't, don't put those ones as the most interesting.

1 (2h 0m 55s):
Oh no, you say many interesting stuff. No, there's, you know what in terms of new terms. Okay, new terms. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Newcastle. Yeah, yeah. Sunland, sorry, I, that was one of the most interest concepts. I I, but I'm learning is the point. I wasn't, I I wasn't being sarcastic that when you, we sit and we're just scrolling Yeah. We're, we're, we're more or less body still mind active. But guess what? None of it's coming from within. It's all coming from the outside. So whether or not it's psilocybin in the eye mask or, or Carl sitting there eyes closed deliberately still thinking, or Feynman in the, in the salt e equilibration chamber, you know, the, the float flotation tank or, or Rick lying there thinking whatever it is he happens to be thinking whatever amazing album he's gonna now, you know, help produce more Einstein.

1 (2h 1m 44s):
I mean, you know, we can think of the phone and the scrolling as, as lending itself to less ability to focus in aviation, but just the real crime, the real insult to humanity. For me, the real cost is what about all the creative imagination of things that come from inside that could be generated by, by people in that time. So I, I'm, I've started doing a practice of 20 minutes a day of just sitting and eyes closed typically. Sometimes it's right as I wake up, but usually it's not. And just trying to think about certain topics and hold those topics in a kind of linear way or sometimes just letting stuff geyer up. Hmm. Anyway, some people might think of this as like completely wacko woo, new agey stuff, but the, the list of names I I read off there, people that do that and have been doing this for a long time and attribute this practice as one of the major sources of their best ideas is a non-trivial list.

0 (2h 2m 41s):
When I think about that, there's a few different ways that it slightly similar. The number of people who've had great ideas whilst walking and attribute an awful lot of their success to walking and thinking. Right? And whether that you're talking body still mind active, but it's like body mostly still, it's not exactly like, yeah.

1 (2h 2m 57s):
Or, or perhaps there's a unique way to access this too. Maybe it's a different channel to a different brain state. Maybe it's a different channel to the same brain state. Like, I love doing long rocks and long runs on Sunday. That's my goal on Sunday. Get out as much as possible into the nature and just move in some sort of repetitive way. Like a mu author on a ruck sack. 'cause Peter Atia got me into that. Hmm. Sometimes it's with other people, sometimes alone. Sometimes I listen to a podcast, sometimes I don't, sometimes an audio book, sometimes they don't. But something about, about motor repetition. So this is not sets in reps, this is not acking the play. This is, you know, minimum amount of cognition required, dump, dump, dump, dump, freeing up mental space to do other things. Yeah. Could be on the rower.

1 (2h 3m 37s):
So again, I think different people would do it differently. I've been hanging around with a lot of musicians lately. I, I've become good friends with one of my favorite musicians, songwriters, Tim Armstrong, lead singer for rancid transplants. He and Travis Barker did transplants. And you know, it's, it, and you know, it's clear that musicians, especially drummers, but other musicians, while they're, they're always in a rhythm in their head. They're actually, Tim and I the other day, we, we went someplace and we walked out. He's like, did you hear that? I'm like, did you hear what? He's like, you didn't hear that. I was like, well he is like, you know, they had the news on and the radio on And, they, you know, he's so tuned into the audio environment. I'm not, right. I'm not that audio or oriented, more visually oriented. But you know, people who have an internal rhythm that they're, they're, they're, they're noodling on something in their head.

1 (2h 4m 20s):
I mean, this is, this is the substrate of creative work, right? And I, and again, the phone isn't evil, but the moment you're taking in sensory input from that includes things that have already been creative, excuse me, created, you're, yeah. You could argue that those are the macronutrients that you're gonna combine for your own creative thing, the gems and the internet. So studies, scientific studies for me are interesting things on YouTube, but there's also just the raw materials of creative work that come from limiting sensory input and just going inside

0 (2h 4m 50s):
Self-generating it. Yeah. So I've been thinking in, one of the things that people want a lot more of, I think is focus, attention, productivity. As someone who values the work output that you do, productivity as a word is quite nefarious. I, I quite nebulous, quite sort of ephemeral. How have you come to think about the concept of productivity and its constituent parts? Have you got any tools, any strategies, tactics that you use to kind of drop yourself into a productive state and stay there?

1 (2h 5m 23s):
Yeah, so I do all the things that I profess, you know, at, at the level of the basics. Morning, sunlight, nons, sleep, deep rest. If I didn't get enough sleep physiological size when I need to bring my level of autonomic arousal, ak stress down, these are all things I've talked about. Three days a week of cardiovascular training, three days a week of resistance training. One day a week of deliberate cold, deliberate heat minimum. Usually on the day after leg day. I do all that stuff. And it creates a structure. And yes, it takes some time and a lot of that stuff can be com combined, excuse me, with consumption of Podcasts and audio books at the same time. And so social time.

1 (2h 6m 3s):
But for me, the process of writing, and I'm working on a book now, but also just the creative process has been greatly enhanced and productivity overall by setting in this 20 minute period where I force myself to just stop and have deliberate thoughts that are within a single context. I don't let my mind wander. So it's very different than maybe the psilocybin journey where it could, it

0 (2h 6m 25s):
Feels, it sounds to me a little bit like active meditation or kind of like narrative meditation in a way. you know, you're forcing your mind to come back to the, you're not just allowing yourself to branch off onto a current Right. Onto a new thought. Okay, here I am, this is the trunk of the tree and I'm gonna to try follow this trunk as high as I can. Right. What about, you know, you're, you're sitting down at the desk, you have the research to do the emails, to write the whatever. What have you got tactically in terms of a priming or a, a structure for that specific situation?

1 (2h 6m 55s):
Yeah, I used handwritten sticky notes and I'll put the thing that I'm supposed to do and I'll keep looking at it because I'm amazed at how often my mind will flip to other things. It's like, oh, I have to transfer some money as somebody that I owe them or I have to pay that bill or I have to, I mean, the number of excuses that leap to mind is outrageous for everybody. Unless we're under deadline fear or extremely rare, but, you know, high motivational states. 'cause we just simply love it. So I give myself five minutes or so to break into the work or five to 10 minutes. I don't expect full focus in that first five to 10 minutes. But here's what I tell myself. 'cause I know from 30 plus years of experience, the feeling that I'm going to get after I complete something, having like really had to push against the grain to force my attention back to that thing, the feeling of having accomplished even a, you know, one hour bow of work is so incredibly rewarding for me.

1 (2h 7m 47s):
And the feeling of having done basically nothing is such an incredible sense of disappointment and lack of life. Like such a, like vitality drain for me. I'm not as hard on myself as I gather. Some people out there are, like David Goggins talks about his self-talk and how he can be very hard on himself at times, but mine isn't like that. But I know how great it's going to feel when I get to the, okay,

0 (2h 8m 16s):
So you are projecting forward the reward that you're going to feel and trying to bring that into the, now that's very smart. I've got written on my other, I've got two, two fridge whiteboards. The other is, what would you tomorrow want you today to do? Right? And that to me is the, it, it's like a panacea for avoiding bad decisions. you know? 'cause you live with the story that you tell yourself about the decision for way longer than the enjoyment or lack of, of the decision. There is a cookie on the table. I promise myself I wouldn't eat it. And I make a decision about whether or not I eat the cookie. There is either enjoyment or reward enjoyment in eating it or reward of satisfaction of discipline for not eating it.

0 (2h 8m 56s):
That happens now. But what's really important is the story that I tell myself tomorrow about being the sort of person that is a cookie eater or is not a cookie eater. And I think that that framing that we place around the present moment largely determines our experience of it. And I find myself trying to live for future Chris more. And the more that I do that, the better that my life seems to get. There are very few situations in which I make a decision today that I tomorrow would have wanted me to, that turn out to be the wrong decision. And that projecting forward, how am I going to feel in future? This is difficult now Rick Hanssen, you know, neurons that fire together, wire together.

0 (2h 9m 41s):
Like can you sit with some of the satisfaction after you've done something That's good. Can you maybe even bring that forward a little bit? Give yourself a little Oh yeah, that's how it's gonna do. Yeah. One other thing that I've just been so fascinated by recently, you have been a big proponent and I think have really helped people in getting sunlight in the eyes early on. Let's get ourselves outside walk. I think you taught me about the lateral eye movement can downregulate the amygdala response. All stuff that I'd found on my own just through doing a morning walk and then again like with the alcohol thing gets legitimated through the science. you know, it's something that I did, found it myself. And then I'm like, ah, this wasn't just bro science or some weird quirk of my physiology. This was actually something that can be shown up in the literature too.

0 (2h 10m 23s):
Ian Doris from the Flow Research collective has the flow morning routine. Have you seen this from him? I haven't,

1 (2h 10m 29s):
But I know

0 (2h 10m 30s):
Ian, his morning routine developed with Stephen Kotler to get yourself into flow specifically for deep work and writing is to begin working within 90 seconds of waking because the state of flow and the state of sleep are not far away from each other in terms of brain frequency delta and theater.

1 (2h 10m 52s):
Yeah, they're sort liminal state. Yeah. I, I haven't seen that yet, but I, I'll check it out. I, I am a big believer in the moment you wake up, if you were dreaming, keep your eyes closed and keep your body completely still. Also, similarly, if you wake up from a nightmare and you don't and you want to forget about that nightmare, you need to move your body. There's something about body movement that discards the prior cognitive map. It's Like, it clears the library. Yeah. We're talking about the, the dynamic Harry Potter ish library. I don't wanna give too much credit to Harry Potter. Certainly not to that play. But one thing that I'll, I'll just about the productivity piece before reflect on this further the, because something you said really, really struck a chord with me. you know, I can project to the future me, but that's not exactly how I do it.

1 (2h 11m 34s):
What I'm, I just know because I'm so familiar with it. The feeling that I get, having actually accomplished some small percentage to large percentage of what I was set out to do feels so unbelievably rewarding to me. And I know that it also enhances the social interactions. I'll have. It's like a feeling of self-satisfaction that transcends to an ability to show up with more clarity of mind. I'm one of the, the problems for me in terms of productivity is I'm very strongly affiliative, I'm very fortunate to have a lot of close friends. So if I get a text message from someone, I feel compelled to write them back. Not out of responsibility. Because if it's someone I'm close with, I love that person. Like I love my family, but I, I love my friends, I love my coworkers, colleagues at the podcast.

1 (2h 12m 19s):
I mean, it's, it extends. And this has to do with my upbringing. The fact that my non-biological family became my family before I sort of reconnected with my actual family in a really deep way. But the one exception being my sister and I were, were were, you know, tight, tight the, the whole time. But the, for me, you know, a text coming isn't, isn't a distraction. Like that's the, that's the good stuff in life. That's one of the reasons I'm there. So I have this practice sometimes of imagining that my, my crew, right, as the kids say we're, I'm pretty crude up these days, which is great 'cause it wasn't always the case. They want me to like forage off to where I need to go and collect the gems and come up with the ideas that are going to be the next post, the next podcast, the next scientific study.

1 (2h 13m 4s):
They want that I tell myself they want that for me. Like they're cheering me on. 'cause I know I'm cheering them on. Some are musicians, some do other things. I'm cheering them on. I want them to know, like, I'm here and I want you to go get the stuff and do your thing. And so I imagine that they're doing that for me and I turn my phones off and there's some anxiety in doing that. I'll put in the car sometimes because it's not that I'm, I need to neurotically check the phone 'cause I don't feel safe if I don't hear from them. Like, I love these people and I don't want them to feel as if I'm not available. That's really how it is for me. But I know that, and I think someone said it and I forget the quote, so forgive me. But you know, if you're going to create anything of value in this life, you're going to, even if it's with other people, you're going to have to be willing to, to be on your own for a bit to forage on your own, to take walks alone and then return to people, to your tribe, so to speak.

1 (2h 13m 57s):
And share with them what you've learned. Or maybe even just show up with whatever energy shift has occurred while you were off doing your thing. And so, you know, the, the phones, the phones are a wonderful tool, but I think over the years, I, I lost the ability to be truly on my own and dropped into work. And it's something that I've recovered a lot in the last few years by telling myself that indeed they want me to do that. And indeed I show up so much better to all the relationships in my life if I've done some real

0 (2h 14m 26s):
Satisfied with a good day's work. Yeah.

1 (2h 14m 28s):
Satis or, you know, or just that, you know, got over that, that barrier of resistance, you know, the, the Stephen Pressfield thing of resistance that you, I wrestled with resistance and won. I think we should all want people to win. And I also, and I confess, I'm gonna lose some friends with this, but I, I have variable latency in terms of my text replies. Sometimes it's a day, sometimes it's an hour, sometimes a minute, sometimes it's a month. I love being on a plane and scrolling through old texts and be like, Hey, how's it going? Missed this? And people are like, that was a month ago. Yeah, it was. And you know, I've been busy, you know, I, and, and you know, emergencies are dealt with, but it happens. What's

0 (2h 15m 2s):
Happening in the brain and body when we procrastinate?

1 (2h 15m 5s):
Oh yeah. So Procrastination is super interesting. There are actually some data that Adam Grant shared with me recently that people who procrastinate actually have, tend to be, have access to certain creative states that non procrastinators don't, don't. Because they have to,

0 (2h 15m 20s):
Don't, don't start justifying the Procrastination crowd. That's a dangerous line to go to. Yeah.

1 (2h 15m 25s):
Procrastination, I mean, I mean, what the origins of Procrastination are are complicated and varied to, to really say a single concise statement as to what Procrastination is. But the way to overcome Procrastination is to do something harder than the hard thing that you're putting off. That's very clear. Do something harder. Don't go clean your, like suddenly, if people wanna do their, their taxes, clean their room, clean the garage, organize the gym, whatever, when they don't want to wr write a chapter in their book. but you have to pick something that's worse than writing the chapter in your book and do that for five minutes. That's the way that the, the dopamine reward system works. And some of these stress systems work.

0 (2h 16m 3s):
What would be an example? Gimme, gimme a tactical example of this. Okay.

1 (2h 16m 6s):
Okay. I need to write a chapter on focus and, and tools for focus for my book. I'm finding I'm doing everything but doing that. Let's just set it kind of a fun example. I'll do anything but that. Okay. So then you have to find something worse than that. So for me, worse than that is anything involving a spreadsheet, just the idea of a spreadsheet gives me hives. So I would force myself to do five to 10 minutes of like, like real, like establishing a spreadsheet of my expenses and taxes related to, I don't know, some segment of my work life. I mean, I can't think of anything worse in that moment that doesn't involve physical or psychological damage. So doing that, and then you'll see it will make writing that book chapter very accessible.

1 (2h 16m 51s):
It's a down, it's a downhill cruise from there, but people find themselves doing all these things that they would normally wanna put off as a way to avoid doing the harder thing. So it's, it's about understanding that what is difficult and what you want to put off or do is a dynamic hierarchy. Hmm. I think you can think of it as dynamic subordination, you know, I don't know if that's bothered borrowed from cosplay or from military or B-D-S-M-I, I don't know. I heard it someplace. Yeah. But

0 (2h 17m 19s):
All the places that you mine for information most frequently. Yeah.

1 (2h 17m 22s):
No, it's raccoons and street flight. No, none of those, none of those communities are communities that i, I know very much about. But I was saying it facetiously. But, but the point being, do something harder than the thing you're trying to avoid. Now some people really like deliberate cold exposure for that reason. Because in, and here I'm gonna really, if I've taken heat for, no pun intended for the deliberate cold exposure thing, now I'm really gonna get behind it for the following reason. People who are really into exercise of various kinds, but not deliberate cold exposure, love to push back on people that do posts about deliberate colds. Oh, that's not doing anything. It's not much metabolic lift. Okay. But let's really step back and be honest with ourselves.

1 (2h 18m 2s):
The adrenaline, the, the, the, the pattern of adrenaline release over time from deliberate cold exposure is something that's very hard to recreate safely with other endeavors. you know? Sure, a hard workout is gonna spike your adrenaline and dopamine also, but is it gonna spike it the way that deliberate cold exposure is? No. Also the amount of a, of a mental barrier that one has to get over in a moment. Not there's no like three warmup sets. Like walk on the treadmill, zero

0 (2h 18m 30s):
To 100

1 (2h 18m 30s):
Pre-workout drink. Show me the pre cold plunge drink that makes it easier. Okay. It's called willpower. Yeah. Okay. And now some people come to love deliberate cold exposure, but that's usually for how they feel afterwards. So I think there is so much utility to deliberate cold exposure now, do people have to do it? No, but deliberate cold shower, deliberate ice bath. Deliberate cold plunge is a, is a world apart from all the other self-imposed stressors because of the speed of onset of the stress. Yeah, yeah,

0 (2h 18m 59s):
Yeah. It's even, even more so than a sauna.

1 (2h 19m 2s):
That's

0 (2h 19m 2s):
Right. That's, you get into a, a sauna and it takes time for you to heat up. It takes time for you to get uncomfortable,

1 (2h 19m 7s):
Right? I mean it's, so, it's a very potent tool because of the amplitude and the timing of adrenaline that it creates in what

0 (2h 19m 16s):
Else? What else in the Procrastination dissolving toolkit. So we've got, do something that is harder than the thing that you're trying to get away from. If you can do cold exposure, that's kind of cool. if you are like, I gotta sit down and do this, I find myself for 10 minutes kind of fluffing about trying to do stuff. I go upstairs, I have a cold shower. Okay, that was way more miserable than this is going to be. Yeah.

1 (2h 19m 34s):
If it's miserable, if you Like it, then no, but if it's way more miserable, then that's the thing to do. Pick the miserable thing. I mean, sometimes it'll leave me like hard conversation. You didn't want to have Some people are, you know, certain hard conversations are, are harder than others, easier than others. But, you know, in business, I've never had a hard time having hard conversations.

0 (2h 19m 53s):
People slaying all sorts of demons in an attempt to get away from their Procrastination. That's right. Here, one of the things that I really wanted to talk about was the peril of over Optimisation. I think that before we knew about all of these science-based tools, everyone had an excuse not to be optimized, right? And now we're all educated about this stuff, and I think that a lot of people feel guilt. They can feel guilt because the gap between how effective they are and how effective they could be is felt between them. So given that you spend an awful lot of time thinking about the tools that people can use, how can someone get over this, this guilt of lack of not being where they should be with getting all of their things dialed in.

0 (2h 20m 39s):
you know?

1 (2h 20m 39s):
Well, guilt is rarely an effective emotion, although sometimes guilt and shame can really help us make significant change. you know, the word Optimisation and optimize, I think needs clear definition. And, and I'm not suggesting that you, you are the one that said this, but a lot of people think it means being perfect all the time. Optimisation is something that we need to look at in the context of the moment, the hour, the day, the week, right? If you have a viral infection or you're sick or you're tired or jet lagged, Optimisation is whatever you can do to manage the basic five of, you know, sunlight, sleep, nutrition, exercise, relationships, work productivity that you can.

1 (2h 21m 20s):
So it's about, it's, it's a, it's a verb function. It's not a state to be in, like floating around optimized. It's Optimisation. The verb is a process that we're continually in. I mean, people who are raising kids are exceedingly busy raising kids and they're trying to optimize raising the kids and hopefully taking care of their health as well. So I think people see or hear the long list of science informed protocols that I talk about And, they think, oh my goodness, how am I supposed to do all of that? Well, that's why I keep coming back to the, the basics, right? And look, a little bit of sunlight is better than none. A little bit dimming the lights a little bit is better than, you know, keeping them on a full blast at night. you know, making, you know, eating a few fewer heavily processed foods that are highly palatable is better than you know, and not doing that.

1 (2h 22m 8s):
Right? But, and there are certain people who have immense amounts of self-discipline. I mean, one thing that's, and they're gonna do all the things. I mean, one thing that's absolutely clear is that there's a pattern of people discovering things that make them feel much better and then a need to tell everyone about it. And that's a, that creates a, a bit of a divide for people. One thing that I've tried to do is to say, yes, I do these tools, I do these protocols, but I'm not just sympathetic, but I, you know, empathize with the fact that sometimes things happen, travel, kids illness, you get into an argument with a, with a significant other, you know, or at work or you're just feeling off, you know? And so, you know, it's important to try and do these things on average is my belief.

1 (2h 22m 49s):
And to be, you know, gentle with oneself when the time calls for it. And then there's other times you need to scruff yourself and say like, enough of this, Hmm, like enough huberman Like, it's time to sit down and write this thing. I don't care if you, your phone is ringing or not, I don't care if you want to or not, and you build up your AMCC while you're doing it, right. you know that the, if ever there was a carrot for the hard for doing the hard thing, it's that amm CC activation that makes your AMCC larger, which makes your willpower more accessible in the future. So it's not that I'm unsympathetic to people who are like, wow, this just feels like a lot. But we also have to remember that we should all, I think as a species, be an individual and indi as individuals, excuse me, be striving to do better each day better than yesterday in on the backdrop of what we happen to be dealing with today.

1 (2h 23m 35s):
I, I really, really do. I mean, last week I had a great week up until Thursday, and then something happened Thursday, it was a purely professional thing and it was like everything got derailed. I literally didn't sleep that night. Very rare for me. Very rare. And I was, and it's interesting, the pattern that emerged, I did some reflecting on later after this event passed, which was, there's always this moment where we're like, where we don't want to do damage control, where we're thinking, gosh, if I just hadn't done that, or if that person just hadn't done that, you know, you're trying to control the past. So there's that moment and I've learned you have to let that process take place. You, unless you have the amazing abilities of a, you know, of a special por tier one special operations person who seems to be able to just live in the moment.

1 (2h 24m 17s):
By the way, those guys, I know a lot of them, very close to them, tremendous respect for them, but a lot of them have trouble when they return from that kind of landscape where well, that's done, you gotta focus on the next thing because real life involves sometimes ruminating over the thing that happened and just living in that space of I wish that hadn't happened. Yeah. Now you try and compress that to be a limited amount of time, and then you get to, okay, damage control and damage control sucks because there's the opportunity cost of all the other things that you're not doing while you're doing damage control. So, you know, the human animal, including me, needs to accept that there are certain things that we just aren't gonna get perfect. And I hate doing damage control like everybody does, but I probably hate it a little bit more.

1 (2h 24m 59s):
And under those conditions I just think, okay, you know what, this isn't 72 hours lost. This is an opportunity to learn. And indeed we came out of this situation better had than we not gone into it. But I'll tell you that realization didn't arrive until Sunday. And I was pretty upset on Friday. And I'm not a bad mood guy, I'm not a moody guy. I don't get headaches, I don't get stomach, I'm not moody. People don't grade on me. Even people with very different opinions and things. I'm like, live And, let, let live kinda like co my Bulldog Costello. So I, I guess to, to answer your question very directly here at the end, I think Optimisation is not about removing all negative emotion or physical states. Optimisation is about working with what's right in front of you with the understanding that the human brain in its capacity to think about the past, the present or the future in some combination, sometimes occasionally the anchor is still stuck in the sand a few hours or days back or years back.

1 (2h 25m 52s):
And we have to accept that as part of our normal neural functioning and psychological functioning and, and try and get, you know, and try and get un onboarded and, and move forward. But that when we're in those moments, you know, we have to know that we're in them. And one of the most useful tools that for this was given to me by a podcast guest. The episode hasn't come out yet. Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, who's done a lot on the neurobiology of emotions and psychology of emotions. And you know, she said, and it was so powerful, anytime you feel a high activation state of any kind, you should stop. Because what it's, what's happening is it's revealing to you something very important.

1 (2h 26m 32s):
And if you don't stop to think about why I'm so upset or why I'm so happy, you're gonna miss an important lesson. So this can be positive states too. Anytime you feel like you're getting above eight out of 10 or seven and a half outta 10 on some scale of internal arousal for good or bad reasons. You want to reflect what is the lesson? Do I, gosh, I really love this person. I love this interaction. I love this aspect of my job, so that's gonna inform the next job I take. 'cause I don't love the rest of the job, or this really sucks. And there's a lesson, and I learned a very important lesson in that last Thursday, but I didn't realize it until late Saturday. But I remember on Thursday this thing hit and I was pissed.

1 (2h 27m 13s):
I don't get pissed very often, but I was pissed. And I remember hearing Lisa's voice in my head and thinking, okay, what is this revealing to me? It's a strategic learning opportunity. Three days later, I had in my journal, and I still have in my journal, I have a many journals, but I have one that's permanent that kind of is the distilled out things that kind of rise to the top as truths for me. And it revealed to me that I care, oh, so very much about certain things to the point where I, they're not about my career. They're really about my, my life, my quality of life. And that small cluster of things is something that now I protect inside. I'm stealing Paul CTE's language here, but inside the castle walls of what I consider important.

1 (2h 27m 53s):
Like, I brought some things in that I think before I wasn't reckless with, but I didn't realize it would be like, if you have a prized horse or child and you're letting them play outside the castle walls and you know their marauders out there, but all of a sudden one takes a, a, a, you know, an arrow through the heart and you're like, oh, and it's a huge loss. Well, what do you do with your other horses or children? You bring them inside the castle walls, right? But you, it would be a shame to have, to have that experience in order to recognize how important they are to you. But there were certain things that I was just not protecting. And now I feel so secure. I also feel like I gained a huge lesson. So, so the, the short list here is when it, when the shit storm hits to put it in scientific nomenclature, know that you, you're gonna be focused on this for a while, accept that as quickly as you can, but understand that accepting that itself is its own hard process.

1 (2h 28m 44s):
B, pay attention to those states of high arousal. There are lessons there, even if this is good stuff, even if this is great stuff, the love of your life, you're now getting engaged. There's lessons that there's things to be gleaned that you'll want to go back to later. And then three or four days later go back to those things and examine them from some different perspectives. Because I think they're huge lessons in these high arousal states, whether or not it's high arousal because of terrible things, or high arousal because of good things. And I think having a process for moving through that is something I didn't have, and I'm still learning to cultivate. And you know, gosh, if you wish that you hadn't spent as much time on the phone or other people's wish, they haven't spent as much time on the phone. I wish I had known or had a process for dealing with things that happened to me or that I created that were unfortunate for myself or others.

1 (2h 29m 31s):
They created for me a process of moving through that, that semi-structure that accepts that you're giving up some degree of control, but that there's the opportunity to regain control and establish lessons that you never, ever would be able to access purely retroactively.

0 (2h 29m 47s):
Yeah, that's kind of like alchemy, like taking something which is, you know, objectively a pretty crap situation and turning it into something which is really, really useful. There was a, a quote that stuck with me that you tweeted last year, or maybe you just taught it to me. I can't remember advice I got early in my career. Don't overage in any controversy unless you're willing to stake your entire reputation on it. Rather keep focused on discovering new things and creating, or else you become known for the controversy and nothing else that is no going back.

1 (2h 30m 19s):
Right? Yeah. This isn't about avoiding being canceled because I think some people might translate it to mean that, which is why I say it's not about that. It's about, you know, we're given this enormous privilege to communicate our thoughts very fast now through social media. And whether or not you have a big following, small following or no following, it is still a privilege. And it's something that I've learned to really think through and guard and protect as an asset, right? That we have. And I've thought about this from the beginning of posting on things online and set up certain rules for myself. For instance, I try to ensure that 90% of my posts are really for the pure benefit of the, the audience and not for my own entertainment.

1 (2h 31m 7s):
Occasionally I'll see something and I'll have a one of these, like, you know, I'll see something, an animal post or something, I'm like, oh, that's so cool. Or the other day I saw something on a, on AX account about, you know, bumblebees that sleep inside of flowers. And it was really cool about how they look at polarized light and stuff. But I just was really tickled by this fact. I thought other people might be as well, but it was more for my own entertainment frankly. But 90% of what I put out there, I'm really trying to think, will people benefit from this? Will they learn from it? Not are they gonna be interested in it, but are, are they gonna learn from it? Will it get them thinking or doing something beneficial to their mental health or physical health? Lord knows I've been attacked for, you know, saying, Hey, this is an interesting study about deliberate cold exposure. And then people are like, oh, it's underpowered.

1 (2h 31m 48s):
And you know, it's a marginal effect. And you know, and I love this because I come from the field of science. It's sort of funny. It turned people loose on a paper. We, because you know, you're gonna get a range of opinions because no two people read the same paper the same way. And everyone would like to say that they are the arbiter of truth and how to read papers, which just makes me chuckle normally. Those people have not published very many papers themselves. It's sort of this inverse relationship. But nonetheless, I like to put things out there that stimulate thinking, positive thinking. I don't like controversy for sake of controversy, but you and I have colleagues in the podcast space, and there are many people in who are public facing who see a current event, And, they just say what they think and you know, what more power to them.

1 (2h 32m 29s):
but it is an, I will say it is a distractor from a larger message that they likely have if they have one at all. But, and, and you see this, and it's not that they go down, what happens is they, they take their audience that has been built around a certain set of topics and suddenly they're talking about current events. I guess what I'm basically saying is I don't talk about current events. Yeah,

0 (2h 32m 52s):
You've never, I really, as far as I'm aware, you've never commented on politics. You've never made any

1 (2h 32m 57s):
No, I actually, this is, I've politics came to around, to me in an interesting way. I'll just share this because it's, it's exactly how it happened. Rogan had Robert Kennedy Jr. On his podcast. Okay. And I liked the post and I commented, and the comment was the following. I said, I hope all I, I hope all presidential candidates go on long form Podcasts, because I happen to believe that it's a great way to get to know candidates. P plural. Oh fuck

0 (2h 33m 28s):
No. So didn't someone edit your Wikipedia

1 (2h 33m 31s):
Page? Okay, so in the, so this is interesting. So I got calls from colleagues of mine at Stanford. I got literally calls and texts. I got calls from major media outlets asking whether or not I'm a RF k supporter slash anti-vaxxer. To which I said, I don't know how you concluded that. Okay, that's certainly not my stance, right? My politics are my politics. But, but there was a huge leap from, and I said, and I, in my comment, I said, you know, I, I look forward to listening and I hope all the candidates go on long form Podcasts. I also see Robert in the gym, and he always looks like he's training hard. He trains hard,

0 (2h 34m 5s):
He's in good condition. Yeah.

1 (2h 34m 6s):
He wears jeans, which I don't understand when he trains, but anyway, but he trains hard, odd

0 (2h 34m 10s):
Choice.

1 (2h 34m 12s):
Odd choice, but it, free, free country. So be it. So, so be it. So was I commenting on the content of the, of his podcast? No. Was I commenting on you

0 (2h 34m 20s):
Probably hadn't even listened to it yet.

1 (2h 34m 21s):
I hadn't listened to it yet. So, but was interesting was in the subsequent days I got an onslaught of kind of assumptions or presumptions really what they were. And then yes, my, I mean this isn't about, maybe this is the time I, I published over 70 peer reviewed articles that are indexed on PubMed, you know, many of which had secondary sources in time and, and other major outlets that covered the, the findings for the relevance to the general public at the time. This is around 2016 mostly, but in the subsequent years as well. That was scraped from my Wikipedia scraped from Wikipedia.

0 (2h 34m 54s):
You mean like scrubs removed? Removed from Wikipedia?

1 (2h 34m 56s):
Yeah, yeah. Removed. Oh, my research contributions are not there on Wikipedia anymore. Still, still. And, and then it was, there were assertions that I was an anti-vaxxer, there were assertions that, that I was supporting certain political agendas and, and so on. And then the, the page was locked by the editorial staff. I've had communications with the founders of Wikipedia, who the page has been adjusted somewhat, but not none of my research has been put back. I I actually am at this point. I, I think it's sort of interesting because it's such, it's more, actually, it's kind of fortunate that it happened in the sense that it's more telling about how the kind of editorializing around Wikipedia exists than it, this is really not about me.

1 (2h 35m 38s):
I'm, I'm telling this, this anecdote as a way to sort of reveal what was my experience. Makes very clear that, you know, now it includes some, some positives, some negatives about the podcast. That's fine. We, we cover supplements. Some people are, are and promote supplements in certain contexts. Mostly behavioral tools, but supplements too. And so I'm perfectly fine with that being included 'cause that's true. but it was very interesting to see how when a, the, the way that sort of people will pick up the ball and run with things. Yeah. And, and it's, and it's, it's been super useful for me to understand this because what it's allowed me to do, at first it was like, hey, like what's this about?

1 (2h 36m 19s):
Then I tried to figure it out. Then I went, you know, straight to the top in terms of trying to understand. And I realized it's like, okay, what do I really love doing? I love forging for information that can benefit people's mental health and physical health. I love organizing that information. I love dispersing that information to the best of my abilities. And, and those are the things that make me happy. And those are the things that seem to resonate with a certain number of people. Those are also some of the same things that seem to irritate a certain number of people. And, and I love doing it. And so what I'm gonna do is just return to doing that. Yeah. And I learned a lot about the landscape of online information in the process.

0 (2h 36m 56s):
Very formative experience. It seems

1 (2h 36m 58s):
Very formative. And as an academic, you know, all the pa my papers are on PubMed. There's no, unless a paper is retracted or corrected, there's no removing things from the library of

0 (2h 37m 6s):
Congress. Yeah. So your Google scholar will just be kind of like, no one's going in there. Yeah.

1 (2h 37m 9s):
My age index is fixed. And it's not to be very clear, I wanna be very clear. 'cause I don't want to contradict the, the very thing that I opened up the question, which is this is not, this is not something I want to like die on the sword of. Right? Of course. but it, it, it really alerted me to the fact that so much of the information that's on the, on the internet has been massaged in, in a particular direction based on presumptions. So one of the reasons I'm taking this opportunity to talk about this is not to counter major media news outlets. They're just trying to make a living for, it's kinda interesting. They have a lot of the same advertisers that my podcast does. you know, I don't advertise Fendi bags, but, but you know, they use advertisers. We, we use them. It makes it free to everybody as a consequence.

1 (2h 37m 50s):
But I think that it's really important for people to realize that this question of like, what can we, who can we trust? What can we trust? We all have to learn to be good scientists and forages of information. And, and, and the macro for me is that hopefully people are learning to forage for information better as a consequence of understanding that like, yeah, no one person holds the truth. This is not Mount Olympus.

0 (2h 38m 12s):
Right. So I think the interesting thing, one of the reasons why you might have seen an outsized response to this is people aren't used to you being in anything. Right? Like the, the, the biggest conspiracy that Andrew Huberman is gonna be a part of is like some new study on sunlight in the eyes or something. It's Like it, the where's the P value and stuff. It's like, it's, it's like, it's not accessible to the normal

1 (2h 38m 36s):
Person called plunge Mafiaa.

0 (2h 38m 37s):
Precisely. Yeah.

1 (2h 38m 38s):
There is, by the way, a cold plunge mafiaa.

0 (2h 38m 40s):
Who are they? Yeah.

1 (2h 38m 41s):
Well I'm of them. I'm not gonna talk about it.

0 (2h 38m 43s):
It's like a, what's it called? It's the sicaro's. You've got the brotherhood. You've made a blood swap.

1 (2h 38m 47s):
Yeah. I probably shouldn't have said that. You can keep it in, but it's, it's a pretty, it's, it's a strong group. Pretty

0 (2h 38m 52s):
Intense. Let's just say understand

1 (2h 38m 53s):
Politically, socially, financially understood.

0 (2h 38m 55s):
Very powerful.

1 (2h 38m 56s):
Very powerful. Very, very cold. Understand. I understand why people are nervous about the cold

0 (2h 38m 59s):
Plunge. It's me too. Yeah. So lots and lots of people online get known for their expertise within one area and then start to think to themselves, well why, why shouldn't the world know about my opinion on the Ukraine conflict? Like, I've got lots of things to say and everybody thinks that it's very, very valuable. So maybe I should contribute to what we should do about climate change or what we, what we think should happen in the next election. And I think that, you know, to your credit, you've done a really good job. 'cause you'll have opinions. You've just chosen not to share them. Sure. Presumably. Right. And

1 (2h 39m 37s):
I vote.

0 (2h 39m 38s):
Yeah. So, but you've chosen not to do that. And I think that it's almost like the sensitivity dial was turned up so much. It's like, where's the first ever society we, we knew, we knew that it was the tattoos and the beard. We always knew that that guy was like a, like an RFK or do you know what I mean? And any opportunity for somebody to jump on this. Right. So this is something that I've been kind of noticing in myself, somebody asking me this, I'm doing these live shows at the moment, so I know that you do live shows too.

1 (2h 40m 5s):
Oh great. I wanna come to one of your live shows.

0 (2h 40m 6s):
We, well, we're not doing LA I'll find you a date. Live

1 (2h 40m 10s):
Shows are so different than Podcasts and I I learned, I

0 (2h 40m 13s):
Can't wait to hear what is your arousal state before you step on stage?

1 (2h 40m 18s):
Oh, I mean, I have a whole pro set of protocols. So we can talk

0 (2h 40m 21s):
About. Would you, would you, would you send me them? Sure. Yeah. I would love, I would love,

1 (2h 40m 24s):
I spend the whole day basically in a rhythm and I talk to only a limited number of people and I've got a rhythm in my head. And I'm, I'm in an SDR hypnosis part of the day. I send in, receive a few texts of Rick, my friend Tim Armstrong, my friend Jim Thibo. I touch base with my team. I do prayer. I'm, I am like, I'm in an altered state. I need all the help looking

0 (2h 40m 49s):
Forward. I'm looking forward to the protocol. I've got my tour, my first UK and island tour is happening in November. And then I'm going to Dubai. We've got a huge 2000 person show in Dubai. Oh, that's exciting. Then we're gonna do Canada in the US Anyway, I got asked recently, I'm doing work in progress shows like a comedian for these. So I'm doing 40 person shows at East Austin Comedy Club. All of the profits go to charity. I wanted to work out my material right before I went on stage, even though it's not, it's not comedy stuff, but I wanted to, to do it. And it's been really, really useful because I've been able to watch, I shouldn't really open with that story. It's not So. we can move that a bit later. It's a bit heavy. It's a whatever, whatever. So we got

1 (2h 41m 25s):
A lot of thoughts about this. Yeah.

0 (2h 41m 26s):
So somebody asked me at one of these shows what some of the unseen prices are that you pay for building a platform of this size. And what I realized was both you and I just like doing the shows that we do. Like I love, I, there is nothing that I would prefer to do at 4:23 PM on a Friday afternoon than sit down and have this conversation. There is nothing that I would rather do. Right. And if you do that for long enough, you end up accumulating the size of an audience that carries with it responsibility that you didn't ask for and didn't ask to have my like and comment on my friend Joe's Instagram post scrutinized by mainstream media and trended across a Twitter.

1 (2h 42m 15s):
Right? Well, not only that, I had colleagues calling the saying not what is happening to you, but literally what happened to you. Right.

0 (2h 42m 22s):
Isn't that awesome?

1 (2h 42m 24s):
But the same week that we published a clinical trial, so it was not as if like my scientific career. So it was pretty interesting. I actually, I had very fruitful conversations with those people. I I know what I, I eventually figured out what the answer is to the, the question you asked before. Hmm. Which is still in, in this vein, which is here, here's the thing. There's a certain segment, in fact, a very large segment of listenership, viewership and media that want to see you and me and other people do what they would do in a given circumstance. For instance, why didn't you counter so and so when they said blank?

1 (2h 43m 5s):
Yep. Why didn't you stand up for this group when you had the opportunity on that situation? What they're basically saying is they wish they had had the opportunity and they're angry that you're not tip of the spear for them in circumstances that they don't have access to. Yep. I get it. But one th one thing that I learned early on by observation is that a sense of justice and a sense of strong opinion about certain things is incredibly important. I mean, that, that runs in my family. but you have to know when justice needs to line up with action or when justice is time to walk away. Yeah.

1 (2h 43m 45s):
When you're not the best suited for something. The other thing that, and I have to say Joe Rogan is the best at what I'm about to describe, and I admire it so much. First of all, I'll go on record saying that I think Joe Rogan has been clearly net positive for science, bringing about lots of different conversations about tons of topics. Let's just leave the vaccine thing aside for the moment. But sleep, the, the, the cosmos, Matthew Walker 11 on a le key, right? Peter Atia and on and on. Okay. It's very clear whether or not he's aware it or not, that he's not gonna be leveraged by anybody. No one's gonna come on to show it.

1 (2h 44m 26s):
He's, he can't, he doesn't allow himself to be used. Right. So when someone gets upset that you're not taking a stand that they would take, they're upset that they can't use you to reach their ends. And you know, I have many flaws like anybody, but maybe a few extra. I really do. And but one, but, but included in that extensive list of flaws is not the capacity to be used. It just is not, I have strong opinions and there's time for justice and action along particular lines. And I prefer to do that not using my social media platform or podcast platform in part because there's a tremendous number of things that I wanna learn about and teach about guests.

1 (2h 45m 6s):
I want to have on to educate as many people as possible. So I'm not being political or diplomatic, I'm being extremely strategic. I'm saying I'm not gonna be used to achieve somebody else's end.

0 (2h 45m 17s):
I wanna,

1 (2h 45m 18s):
That's basically what it is. And so I'm, I think very hard about like, the things I want to take on. And they're mostly about helping people regulate circadian rhythms, stress, sleep, eating disorders, depression, understanding of self through a mental health series, Addiction, sleep, you know, I said sleep multiple times and on and on. And the other stuff is really barbed wire. You can get snagged on it and stuck there. Yeah. And then you're tossed up against the barbed wire and you're fighting and you're bleeding out. And guess what? A bunch of really great stuff is happening so that you could be focusing on

0 (2h 45m 50s):
Stuff. Dude, I often, I always think

1 (2h 45m 52s):
That's really what it is.

0 (2h 45m 53s):
I always think about how much of some of the smartest minds of our generation's time has been taken up, arguing over pick your topical issue, headline of the moment. Like what, what else could have been achieved if these people who outside of the myopia and, and like catastrophe that is most of pop culture headline stuff are phenomenal thinkers. And yet they have a, it's like the kryptonite that there's something that pulls them away. Oh yeah. And I want, I wanna rip them back in. Oh, well

1 (2h 46m 27s):
My thumbs start buzzing. you know, there's the pre-motor circuits that get me wanting to put something times.

0 (2h 46m 31s):
How often do you, how often do you type and delete? Does that happen much three

1 (2h 46m 35s):
Times a day?

0 (2h 46m 36s):
You're kidding.

1 (2h 46m 37s):
No, but not because of political Yeah, yeah. Reasons, but, or sensitivity issues. But yeah, about three times a day, I, there are a lot of posts that just don't go up because I'm Like it's not gonna land. Right. I don't touch on current events. I mean, our friend Lex Friedman covers a lot of current events and gets right in the middle. I mean, he likes to, he'll travel to current events. Yeah. you know, he'll land himself in, in, in dangerous territories. I think also something that's really helped me, I had great scientific advisors and mentors coming up. I also, I ke I understand the limits of having one brain and one personality and one history. And I have a council of people that I refer to often. It's funny, I brought my notebook today, which I'm always carrying around one of these little notebooks. I'm writing on cards and things.

1 (2h 47m 18s):
And in the front of this notebook is a list of names. I didn't think we'd get into this at all today, but, you know, a list of names of people that I, I look at this

0 (2h 47m 26s):
List. Is that the Council of Huberman? Right. There it is. And who's, who's in the co who's,

1 (2h 47m 29s):
Well, I I'm not, I'll give you a non-exhaustive but accurate list. I mean, it includes Rick Rubin close friend, Peter Attia close friend. It includes Joe Strummer, Oliver Sachs, both of whom are dead and who I never met. But I've consumed their writings and I know people close to them and I have stories about them. It's got a couple people whose names I'm not gonna disclose. There, there are a few others here that maybe my dead advisors, all three of them, my dog Costello had a, he couldn't be, he, he was so stubborn, you could not get him to do something he didn't want to do. It was like he would, he, you couldn't move him. And he always was right about the things he didn't wanna do. He had an incredible sense of, of understanding about his, his environment.

1 (2h 48m 13s):
My sisters on here and then, you know, my team Whot aren't just my team, but Rob, Mike, Ian, Chris Martin, Gary, Greg, like Sarah, they're, they're here. Right? So these are like, anytime I'm gonna put something into the world, I look at this list and I think like, okay, I don't need unanimity, but like, what would they say about this? And because I don't need to text them most times, nine times outta 10, I know

0 (2h 48m 39s):
What it's, can infer it just by knowing them. Yeah, absolutely. So this, this is, this is something I really, I really wanted to kind of touch on because you've gone,

1 (2h 48m 45s):
And there are others on that list. So for those that I didn't include, it's like a, I wanna be real, they know Jim Thibo, right? They know. Yeah. Joe's on here. you know,

0 (2h 48m 53s):
It's like, it's like you're doing an award ceremony now.

1 (2h 48m 54s):
Lex is on here. I mean, you know, so I mean, it's just so clear to me that my brain can't do it right all the time. And I need to call on people alive and dead, like known and that I haven't known to, to help me. And you know, it feels sort of corny to talk about. But if there's one thing I've tried to do with the podcast, it's to normalize some of the conversations around things like anxiety, stress, sexual health. We've been doing a lot about hormone sexual health for women and men communication, you know, normalize some of the discussion around these practices that, that to some people might seem kind of hokey. But to me, I mean, this list isn't like three out of 10 in terms of the potency scale of like my productivity and feelings of, of safety in life so that I can go do my best work.

1 (2h 49m 38s):
It's like 11 out of 10. Yeah. 11 out of 10. And it, it's the kind of thing where most of these people don't even know that. No one knows they're on their list until on this list until now. But I've always had this list in different forms and it's updated over the years. When I was a kid, I mean, growing up I had a hero. Listened to him every day of my life from 13 on Tim Armstrong lead singer for rancid Operation Ivy transplants. you know, like literally every day. And through some magical stroke of luck, we've become very close friends. So he was guiding me all along. But he's about, he's 10 years older than I am. He has deep, he's extremely smart.

1 (2h 50m 18s):
Extremely smart. And he has deep understanding of human dynamics and how to be in the world while trying to do creative work. Now he's a musician, not a scientist, but his level of curiosity, intellect, memory, I mean it's, it Like it doesn't just for years it inspired me. But now, like I'll text or call Tim, I did that last week. Like, hey, I, this is a tough situation. Really helped me. I called a few other people too, but he's on this list and he has been since I was 13. How wild is that? It turns out, you know, never meet your heroes. Right? Well it turns out this hero ended up like wildly exceeding, you know, my expectations in the positive direction. You

0 (2h 50m 55s):
Do know that there's someone listening to this. There's probably millions of people listening to this. At least not thousands to whom you are that person. Right. That you, they have this parasocial relationship with you. Even if you didn't ask for it. Even if Parasocial,

1 (2h 51m 9s):
I like that. It's almost like paranormal,

0 (2h 51m 10s):
But parasocial. Yeah, parasocial. That's the term. I write that down. Get it in there along with whatever it was cosplay. And we've got a good list. And Cuba Husbands, Cuba daddies. I'm really fascinated by what's, what it's been like to be a relatively unknown academic working in the annals. Just doing your thing, doing your research to now as a byproduct of a passion to share science-based tools for people now being sort of thrust out into the public. What's the felt sense of this rapid increase in exposure and Scrutiny and fame being like,

1 (2h 51m 47s):
So I'd love to tell you that it's disorienting, but truly by virtue of feeling very aligned with the work and purpose of the work that I'm doing, I feel like I'm, at least in terms of my daily activities and where my mind is at, I'm exactly where I for the first time, I'm like exactly where I, I feel like I'm exactly where I belong. Not because I'm known and the, the podcast has achieved this Recognising for which I'm very grateful and humbled by. But because I love foraging for organizing and dispensing information, so 95% of my cognitive powers are set toward like the episode I'm preparing for next week or the week after.

1 (2h 52m 31s):
And I have to like literally pull in my impulse to now take off on a tangent about my use of toe spacers to fix this like, imbalance 'cause of like foot health. And like I'll, I'll go there. That's the thing. But like it's all getting teed up. I'll, I'll, I prepare for Podcasts. I, someone asks how long it takes me. And I realize in total, because I start so many months ahead, somewhere between very low end, the lowest ever would've been 12. But it's typically more like 150 to two hours of preparation. And I love every freaking second of it. And so for me it feels great 'cause it allows me to do what I'm doing now in terms of being public facing. I mean, I'm a pretty introverted person. I love close dynamics.

1 (2h 53m 12s):
you know, if I think for a second about meeting one-on-one dynamics and small group dynamics, small parties at my house and things, I'm comfortable in crowds, but I'm not interested in, in being in them per se. But if I think for a second about how many people are gonna listen to something, I'll just, I don't know, I, I don't think about it. 'cause it would, that's not to do it best's not to do it. you know, it's changed my life dramatically in, in mostly for the positive, in positive ways. you know, getting filmed while you're in the gym is funny. 'cause you know, I always tell like if ever I need to use perfect form, like nah, nah, I

0 (2h 53m 45s):
Really

1 (2h 53m 45s):
Need to, you know, I'm the guy on the T raise

0 (2h 53m 47s):
Machine. So that's the real, that's the real scandal. It's not that you like a Joe and RFK post, it's the fact that you can't do preach curls with perfect temper. Oh,

1 (2h 53m 54s):
I'm full, I'm a full range of motion guy. I'm a full range of motion guy, but I am the guy on the TIB machine every day. Not every day, but any day I'm in the gym. Yeah, yeah. Getting filmed when you're not aware that you're getting film, some security breaches in that it, not directly towards me, but towards members of my family and community that those have been a annoying. But that goes with the territory and it'd been mostly lucky. 99% of interactions are immensely positive when people come over and say hello, I, I enjoy it. I, it's, you know, I don't always have a lot of time. So there's those kinds of things, but I'm somebody who's genuinely curious about other people. So in those interactions, like I wanna learn about them. I already know about me. I wanna learn about them. Yeah.

1 (2h 54m 33s):
I, I've always been genuinely curious about other people. This isn't a line. Like I, I've been friends with the garbage man, the janitor, the, you know, my dentist. Like, you know, well there I've got stuff in my mouth, so I can't, it's a one way conversation. But, you know, learning about people I think allows one to also deliver information in a way that's more accessible to people.

0 (2h 54m 56s):
This is something that I'm a, I would guess I would go as far as to say that the level of fame and Recognising that I have now is about as like goldilock zone as it's, as it's possible to get, it's maybe once every 10 to 15 minutes if I'm walking in a crowded area somewhere and it'll be a 10 minute convers, a ten second conversation of, hi mate, really love the podcast now. Or like the Amazon Prime delivery driver shouted out of the window the other day.

1 (2h 55m 20s):
And those are the people that, that, that allow us to do what we do. Right? Like there's like those, I'm so grateful that people are interested in the kinds of information that you put out and that I put out. I mean, I look at them, I, I look at anyone I interact with as the students in my classroom the same way I would, the way I manage my comment section on social media, classroom rules. You can say whatever you want Dick to me, but don't be, don't be uncool to other people and or I'm gonna block you. Why? It's not like I can't take it. Listen, I grew up in skateboarding. I grew up in academia. The hazing process in those communities very different was intense. It was physical, psychological, emotional torture at times.

1 (2h 56m 0s):
And so you develop a very thick skin. I mean, skateboarding, if you do something and you don't make it look right or something's a little off you, like, you're gonna own that reputation for years. And so that's

0 (2h 56m 12s):
Your new nickname. Yeah. You,

1 (2h 56m 13s):
You have to have your, I I'm not gonna say it the way I'd say it back then, but like, I mean, you have to have every, your kit has to be right, everything has to be right and yet you have to try things. And so it's, you know, learning to work through the narrow constraints of, of social media is nothing compared to trying to come up through academia where people say, oh, nice, nice, great to see you. And then they kill your papers or grants behind your back. It's, it's a game of backstabbing now. They put reviewers on, on names, on papers. So it, it conditioned me for it. I will say this, I'm very grateful that all of this happened in my forties, my mid forties. I started the podcast when I was 45. I'm 48 now. It's been three

0 (2h 56m 52s):
Years. Why, why, why that timing? I just

1 (2h 56m 53s):
Think about the young brain, the twenties, thirties, you know, so much of, of our identity is formed earlier in life, but we're still trying to figure out who we are. I know exactly who I am. So you've got, I'm the guy that since age five has been gathering, organizing, and disseminating information. I like lots of different kinds of people. I like misfits and runts and winner and like, and you know, and jocks and punkers and hippies and I have gay friends and straight friends, like live And let live. I love it all. And so I, I oriented towards skateboarding and punk rock because it was like all the styles, all the hairstyles. So I mean, people think of like, just like bullet belts and Mohawks. No. Then you got your peace punks and you got your vegan punks and you got all this like, and I have my thing what I liked, but I love the variety because I love the flora and fauna of life.

1 (2h 57m 38s):
I don't love raccoons or Capy bars per se, but I love how they fit into the animal kingdom. And I, I have an obsession with animals and weird animals and cephalopods and the octopuses and the, you know, the platypus is, and, and all of it. And so for me, like being on social media, I get to step back and look at all of it. But I'm not gonna let anyone decide who I am or who I'm not. Like I'm the guy who was wearing black shirts before. My colleague David Feld will tell you this, he's a professor at uc, Santa Cruz. He once tweeted, he was like, he always wore the black shirt. And I was like, yes, it's true. I didn't change it all. I didn't feel like I had to modify myself. I know, you know, I always tried hold the door for people. I, I I tried and my perfect, no.

1 (2h 58m 20s):
So it's changed things a lot and yet it hasn't changed me at all.

0 (2h 58m 28s):
I love it. Dr Andrew, Huberman. Ladies and gentlemen, dude, I really appreciate you very much appreciate the support you've given me over the last year when I've needed to text you when I've needed little bits and pieces. It really does mean a lot to me. So what can people expect remainder of 2023? What have you got coming up?

1 (2h 58m 42s):
Okay, well I can tell you, but first can, can I just please just take a moment and say thank you for this opportunity. Thanks for the kind words. I will say something very important about you, which is that, you know, coming up in the various sports I did skateboarding and science, I have a really good eye for the, the person. Like, I'm gonna put my money on that person to be at the top at some point down the line. And it's interesting because I'm not talented at many things. I'm proficient at certain things. I work really hard, truly if I have any inborn abilities. It's, my memory has always been sharp. But loving the thing you're learning helps.

1 (2h 59m 26s):
Early on when I saw your content, it created some sense in me based on how you were delivering it, the passion, the honesty behind it, and the ways in which you were quite like moving through and trying to figure it out. That I was like, this guy's gonna be like at the top. And I, I was, I was right in that your ascent trajectory predicts that. Like, I, I mean, okay, there's still room for upward trajectory. Great. But you know, every once in a while someone comes along where you're like, he just loves what he does. It's so clear that he's meant to do this like you love. And I think it has a lot to do with the genuineness, which, which you invite on and meet your guests.

1 (3h 0m 6s):
Like you're not gonna put someone on 'cause they're gonna get clicks. You're, you're gonna invite people on because you really want to talk to them. And that, that's very clear. And I think, I know that resonates with people. So I've been truly an avid consumer of your content from Go. And it's been awesome to see your ascent and I'm sure that this is just the beginning. So I wanna say thank you. thank you. you know, thank you. And, and I, I look forward to deepening our friendship. And I, that's a real thing because early on when Lex and I became friends through podcasting, at some point I realized I was like, we need to hang out without these microphones in front of us. I went out to Austin for two weeks and we just hung out. We just hung out. It's also where he did the Juujitsu thing where he choked me out. Choke you out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So got me there.

1 (3h 0m 47s):
I'll get you back Lex, but not with Juujitsu psychological Juujitsu. But I hope we get the chance to spend time and I really just wanna say what whatever you're doing, keep going because it's awesome and it's clear that you're really working hard on your craft and I'm really excited about the lives and we, we can talk about that. thank you. Rest of 2023. I'm gonna try and finish this book that I've been procrastinating on for a few years now. It's mainly gonna be a book of protocols, so it's very straightforward as to what to do. It's kind of the what to do stuff, not so much story. I think there's a need for that or so I,

0 (3h 1m 20s):
You know, that's gonna, that's gonna break the world when that thing comes out.

1 (3h 1m 23s):
Well it, I'm putting my heart and soul into it. I I

0 (3h 1m 25s):
You got any, you got an idea of completion date and then publication

1 (3h 1m 28s):
Date? Yeah, pre-sales should probably be February and, and it should come out end of 24. Yeah. So, and I'm putting everything I've gotten to that book while still podcasting. We're gonna do a series, we've done these guest series. We did one with Dr. Andy Galpin on Fitness. We did one on mental health with Dr. Paul Conte. And we're gonna do one with Dr. Matthew Walker on Sleep and one with Dr. Anna Lemke on Addiction and Dopamine soon. So that the guest series are, are that going forward. And then, you know, there were times when we thought, okay, we need to do something else. Like do we need an app? Do we need, and we've really taken a step back and we're just like, we're just gonna keep searching for organizing and dispensing information, mainly in the form of the Monday podcast.

1 (3h 2m 11s):
Occasionally these guest series, we do have a premium channel that generates revenue that is directed towards scientific studies. I haven't talked too much about this, but a, a significant portion of that has been put to philanthropy, to laboratories working on eating disorders on MINDBODY states on intermittent fasting. How didn't

0 (3h 2m 27s):
You, didn't you recently redo your website? Isn't your website we did the website search more searchable something.

1 (3h 2m 31s):
Yeah, so if you go to human lab.com, the engineers have done a great job where it's highly searchable now and take you to specific timestamps. You could even say like Dopamine Procrastination will take you to that particular timestamp. And I think as the AI tools get better, there'll be more things like that. But really it's gonna just be more of the same

0 (3h 2m 47s):
Live shows. More live shows. This year we've

1 (3h 2m 49s):
Got live shows coming up in Australia. So the first one in Sydney sold out the Opera House, one sold out, but there's another one being an out soon. And then there's a Melbourne and Brisbane.

0 (3h 2m 58s):
Where should people go if they wanna sign up for that?

1 (3h 2m 60s):
It's hubermanlab dot com slash tour to get tickets. Hell yeah. And those are fun and they're very different than the podcast and, but you know, I'm not, I joked a, a few months back with traditional media, I wasn't joking that, you know, I might run for office someday. Like from what I've seen of the experience of politics, like I wanna retract that statement. I have zero minus one interest in running for office, but I have every interest in just continuing to, to indulge this, this obsession slash delight that I get from learning and teaching and and sharing information. So like yeah, that's the plan. And you

0 (3h 3m 38s):
Know, keep the main thing the main thing, man. Yeah,

1 (3h 3m 40s):
That's the thing. you know, and, and I never know, like I come from a long line of academic advisors that all died early. Like I hope I'll live a long time, but I don't know if it's gonna be a cancer or bullet or a bust that's gonna take me out or old age. I have no idea. So I'm just, you know, I'm just leaning into this as hard as I can.

0 (3h 3m 55s):
Hell yeah. I appreciate you man. thank you for today. I

1 (3h 3m 57s):
Appreciate you. Thanks so much Chris.

0 (3h 3m 59s):
