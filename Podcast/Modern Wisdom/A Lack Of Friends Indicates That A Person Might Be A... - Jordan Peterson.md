**Chris Williamson:**

One of the things that I’ve realized is that people who are highly self-reflective—who rely on cerebral horsepower, pay close attention, think in a detailed way—the more nuance you bring to your thinking, the fewer people there are “like you,” which makes you feel more alone. How do you think people can overcome that sense of isolation?

  

**Jordan Peterson:**

Well, I’d say that hasn’t been my direct experience, exactly—because as I started to make my thoughts more public, they actually seemed to appeal to more and more people. And so I don’t know if that’s a threshold phenomenon: as you specialize as a scientist, your vision narrows and narrows—though it gets more high-resolution at that level—until you pass through the eye of a needle, and on the other side the thing you’re studying starts to become everything again. Perhaps that’s a developmental progression: specialization and then generalization again.

  

**Chris Williamson:**

Yeah, I think you might be right there. When I went to your “Into the Breach” show in Manchester in 2017 or ’18, someone asked about the depth of their consciousness causing them suffering. You said you take more of the thing that poisons you until you turn it into a tonic that girdles the world around you. I think that’s related: when you start to think differently, in a higher-resolution, more nuanced way, you’ll probably receive pushback. Speaking from personal experience in a normal working-class town—people born, live, die there—it’s insular. Deviating from the norm is very quickly mocked. Tall poppy syndrome is a huge problem.

  

**Jordan Peterson:**

The biggest difference I’ve noticed between American people and English people is that American children are told they can be anything they want. They get “blue sky vision,” which gives them a lot of confidence. When us stiff-upper-lipped Brits hear Americans on TV, it sounds like everyone’s had media training—everyone is enthused about whatever it is, even if it’s an 18-car pileup. In the U.K., deviating from the norm is mocked quickly. Canada’s the same. Japan too: “The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.” There’s some truth in all of these cultural proverbs.

  

**Chris Williamson:**

And then when those American kids become adults, they look around and say, “Hang on—this wasn’t what I was promised. I was told I could have anything I wanted.” They misunderstand “you can earn everything that is earnable” as “you deserve everything there is,” which can become narcissistic.

  

**Jordan Peterson:**

That narcissism is compounded by demographic shifts: people are having children much later, far fewer children, and with more resources per kid. If you’re one child of eight, you fight for attention—your siblings keep you honest. But an only child of older parents, who are more conservative and less willing to take chances, grows up over-protected. That developmental milieu is entirely different, and we don’t really know its long-term consequences.

  

**Chris Williamson:**

I’m an only child myself, and I haven’t noticed those stereotypes playing out so predictably. In your clinical practice, have you found that only children tend to share common traits?

  

**Jordan Peterson:**

I see huge variability among only children. I’m not aware of definitive psychological data identifying a consistent only-child profile. The “coddled American mind” thesis—outlined by Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff—is partly ideological but also demographic. Parents are now about ten years older when they have kids, and families are smaller. That drastically transforms child-rearing. The question becomes: how much should children be left to their own devices? The answer is: as much as they can tolerate, which you learn child by child. It’s entirely possible to over-protect and deprive a child of necessary independence.

  

**Chris Williamson:**

What a fascinating exploration—thank you, Jordan.

  

**Jordan Peterson:**

My pleasure.
