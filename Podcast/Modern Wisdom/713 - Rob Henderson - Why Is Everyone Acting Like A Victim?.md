[PodPulse - #713 - Rob Henderson - Why Is Everyone Acting Like A Victim? - Modern Wisdom Podcast notes and takeaways](https://podpulse.ai/podcast-notes-and-takeaways/modern-wisdom-713-rob-henderson-why-is-everyone-acting-like-a-victim)


Rob Henderson, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge, US Air Force veteran, and author, sheds light on the Friendship Paradox. This concept suggests that individuals often perceive their friends as having more friends, their sex partners as having more sexual partners, and their Twitter followers as having more followers than themselves. Henderson explains that this is because some individuals are super connectors, while others have fewer social connections. He illustrates this with an example involving [Warren Buffett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett) where Buffett's wealth would skew the average wealth in an auditorium, making everyone appear to be a millionaire. Additionally, Henderson references Gad Saad's book, which advises befriending those with fewer sexual partners than oneself.

Henderson also delves into Daniel Kahneman's principle "What You See Is All There Is," highlighting how people focus on visible information, often overlooking the unknown. This ties into the Friendship Paradox, where extroverted individuals stand out, potentially causing others to feel less socially connected. Research supports this by showing that while people generally believe they are superior in various domains, they tend to think they are less socially connected due to the visibility of social experiences online. The 1% Rule further emphasizes this point, stating that only a small fraction of internet users actively create or comment on content, leaving the majority as silent observers.

Henderson touches on the concept of digital leprosy, where individuals may be oblivious to their online cancellation if they are not active on social media. Robert Greene's "48 Laws of Power" is cited, emphasizing the importance of staying engaged in social scenes for maintaining influence. The discussion also introduces the idea of "monk mode," a period of withdrawal for self-reflection and personal growth.

Moreover, Henderson explores the topic of "Young Male Syndrome", describing traits such as risk-taking and increased criminality among young males. Studies show that men are more likely to engage in dangerous behaviors, like not wearing seatbelts with male passengers, to signal toughness. The podcast also discusses how groups of dispossessed, rambunctious young men can exacerbate this syndrome, leading to societal issues. Historical solutions, such as Portugal's use of galleon ships to channel young men's need for adventure, are mentioned alongside modern concerns like the rise of Incel ideology and reduced police presence in inner cities.

Henderson also examines the effects of technology on young men, with Nicholas Eberstadt's research indicating that millions of prime working-age men choose unemployment or dependency over work. These men often feel undervalued by society and lack future prospects. Military service is highlighted as a character-building alternative.

The spread of victimhood culture is attributed to a lack of real challenges in modern life. Henderson contrasts those who succumb to despair with those who embrace hardship and self-improvement. Melissa Carney's "The Two-Parent Privilege" and Gregory Clark's "The Sun Also Rises" are referenced, discussing the advantages of being raised by college-educated parents and the persistence of social status across generations. Scott Alexander's work on assortative mating is also mentioned, revealing limited cross-class matching based on attractiveness.

Despite changes in education and occupation, social and romantic dynamics remain consistent. Carney's book notes the disparity in college graduation rates between children from poor families and foster children. The podcast also comments on political tribalism and its potential to push individuals towards opposing ideologies.

A study is discussed that counters the Incel narrative by showing that men with more sexual partners are likelier to hold misogynistic views. The podcast also addresses cognitive biases that lead people to seek supporting evidence for their preconceived notions rather than questioning their validity. It speculates on women's willingness to take risks with attractive men.

Sadia Khan, a couples counselor, observes that attractive women may develop cynical attitudes toward men due to negative experiences. Chris Rock's concept of a reality distortion field around attractive women is discussed, along with Joe Rogan's and Tucker Max's observations on how status affects interpersonal interactions.

Henderson examines the social capital gained from owning prestigious material goods, using Jordan Peterson's experience in Nashville as an example. A survey of young US voters reveals political preferences as potential red flags in romantic partners, with significant percentages rejecting far-right or far-left identifiers and other specific interests or behaviors.

A 2015 study links higher levels of wealth and gender equality with lower relative happiness for women, a trend known as the paradox of declining female happiness. The study also notes shifts in political leanings and red flags in dating preferences.

The Journal of Happiness Studies reports a decline in women's happiness compared to men's, reversing past trends. Economic disparities within relationships are associated with negative outcomes, despite women's greater emotional intelligence.

Henderson discusses surplus mate value and counter signaling, citing examples of high achievers who downplay their status. Chris Bumstead's reliance on his girlfriend for success and professors at prestigious institutions eschewing formal titles exemplify this behavior.

Henderson's upcoming book combines personal narrative with sociological analysis, focusing on resilience and status evaluation. Alex Ormosi expresses regret for not documenting his struggles, despite his financial success.

Roy Baumeister hypothesizes that concealed ovulation in women evolved to prevent avoidance of pregnancy burdens. Leslie Newsome and her co-author argue that women who evaded pregnancy are not our ancestors, while Candice Blake suggests stress can disrupt ovulation to prevent interference with fertility. Solomon's Paradox is introduced, highlighting the discrepancy between wisdom in addressing others' problems versus one's own.

A study on Solomon's Paradox shows that social distance aids wise decision-making, as demonstrated in the Ultimatum Game and the game show "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire."

Finally, Henderson addresses men's challenges in forming friendships and the importance of shared activities for building social connections. The Men's Sheds Initiative in Australia and personal anecdotes illustrate the benefits of communal projects for men's mental health. Henderson encourages men to pursue hobbies and sports to foster friendships and announces the release date of his book and his presence on Substack and Twitter.

- It can lead to feelings of social inadequacy as people compare their lives to the most visible and extroverted individuals.  
    

### Social Media and Perception

- People tend to overestimate how socially connected others are while underestimating their own social lives.  
    
- The visibility of extroverted people on social media contributes to misconceptions about the frequency of social activities among peers.  
    

### Young Male Syndrome and Mate Deprivation  

- Young male syndrome involves heightened risk-taking and reduced self-control among young men.  
    
- There is a correlation between young men's behavior and their sexual activity, with those having more sex partners being more likely to exhibit extreme behaviors.  
    
- The sedation male hypothesis suggests that modern distractions like video games may be absorbing some of the aggressive tendencies of young men.

- Both men and women generally view far-right and far-left political affiliations as red flags in potential partners.  
    
- Moderate political views are seen as green flags when dating.  
    
- Other factors such as interest in astrology or listening to [Joe Rogan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0736579/) can influence dating preferences differently for men and women.  
    

### Concealed Ovulation Hypothesis  

- Concealed ovulation in women may have evolved to prevent women from avoiding pregnancy by being aware of their fertile periods.  
    
- It could also serve to prevent other women from causing stress during ovulation, which can disrupt the menstrual cycle.  
    

### Solomon's Paradox  

- Solomon's paradox refers to the idea that people reason more wisely about others' problems than their own.
