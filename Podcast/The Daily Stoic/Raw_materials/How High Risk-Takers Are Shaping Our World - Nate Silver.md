Ryan Holiday: Welcome to another episode of the Daily Stoic Podcast. It's funny, I'm working on the Wisdom book now, and I had this chapter that I wanted to do on risk. Just like, how does a wise person understand and relate to risk? It's interesting, right? All the cardinal virtues are so interrelated. Obviously, the courage book is about when you defy the odds, when you take that gamble, when you put yourself out there. And yet wisdom is also sometimes rendered as prudence, right? So not taking unnecessary risks, knowing the dangers, almost kind of a cautiousness. But the reality is that life is inherently risky. I was just thinking about this as I was preparing for today's guest. There's a chapter about bravery, and stillness is the key that I went. So there was, like, a specific person that I wanted to talk to them about. This is like the second to last chapter in Stillness, and I'm talking about this French philosopher. I wanted you to tell you her story because she's, like, amazing. I talk about the main character in Camus, the Fall, and I contrast him to a French philosopher, Anne Dufourmantelle, I say, who died in 2017, age 53, rushing into the surf to save two drowning children who were not her own. In her writing, Anne had spoken often of risk, saying that it was impossible to live life without risk and that, in fact, life is risk. It is in the presence of danger. She once said in an interview that we are gifted with the strong incentive for action, dedication, and surpassing oneself. And when on a beach in Saint Tropez, she was faced with a moment of danger and risk, an opportunity to turn away or do good, she committed the full measure of devotion to her ordeals. What is better? To live as a coward or to die as a hero? To fall woefully short of what you know to be right or to fall in the line of duty? And which is more natural? To refuse a call from your fellow humans or to dive in bravely and help them when they need you? Obviously, not all risk is so existential. A lot of it is much more statistical, which is the subject of today's interview. And I'll connect this to another writing of mine, not because I'm just trying to promote my own stuff, because I really want you to read Nate Silver's new book, on the Edge, the Art of Risking Everything, because it's incredible. I took a bunch of notes. I really, really liked it, and I'm somewhat related to the book because he had reached out to me. I wrote a book a number of years ago called Conspiracy, which is about this billionaire, Peter Thiel, and his sort of secret, daring gamble to go after this media company And I sort of use it as an excuse to explore the idea of strategy and risk and contrarian thinking and doing what people don't expect. It's not like any of my other books, but it's a book I'm very proud of. They're actually making it into a movie. And Peter Thiel is the main subject of that book. Also, this guy Nick Denton is a main subject of the book. And Nate knew Nick but didn't know Peter. And after the book came out, he had reached out to me and asked if I might introduce him to Peter Thiel, who is one of the most fascinating subjects of Silver's new book. As I was saying, on the Edge. So, look, this kind of a rambling introduction I understand, and I'm sure my editor will have cleaned up some of it by the time you get to it. These are all things that I have been thinking a lot about. Like, I literally have this stack of note cards here on my desk. Life is risk. I wrote there is one in every decision. There is risks to questioning, right? To curiosity. Right. It kills the cat. Ultimately, there is no learning without risk. I wrote it killed the cat again. So clearly I wanted to do that. The point is, I've been thinking a lot about the themes of this book, so I was very excited to have it. And then when I finished this discussion, I said to our producer, Claire, I want to have more conversations like this on the podcast, so I hope you really like listening to it. I took a risk. I was supposed to be out of town to go do something, and I decided to stay because I thought this interview was worth doing in person. And Nate's flight was delayed, but he ultimately ended up coming. And I think we had an awesome conversation and we got a bunch of shared people we know in common. So I think this interview is really interesting. And then, as it happens, my wife found out the next week that he had left our interview and then went and had dinner with a woman she's friends with and her husband. So small world. Great interview. His new book, on the Edge, the Art of Risking Everything, is incredible. His book, the Signal and the Noise, is also great. You might be familiar with Nate's work at 538, which has been an incredible predictor of presidential elections. He has a substack. We talk a lot about substacks and audience capture in the interview. You can check that out. It's called Silver Bulletin. And I'll leave you now with me and Nate Silver talking about risk.

Ryan Holiday: Are you technically sort of of the Village because you're in media. But what if you're a media entrepreneur and then you're taking a certain amount of risk and there's a difference there for sure.

> [!summary] "Village" analogy
> Ryan Holiday's "Village" analogy serves as a metaphor for society and its interconnected systems, particularly in the context of media dynamics. The "Village" represents the collective societal framework, where traditional media professionals, such as journalists and broadcasters, operate within established norms, acting as storytellers and maintainers of the status quo. In contrast, media entrepreneurs step outside these conventions, taking significant financial, reputational, and creative risks to challenge existing narratives or disrupt traditional media models. This distinction highlights the difference between being "of the Village," adhering to its norms, and positioning oneself at its periphery or outside it to innovate and reshape societal narratives. Holiday's critique of media systems, as explored in _Trust Me, I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator_, emphasizes the importance of understanding one's role—whether as a participant within the established order or as a disruptor seeking change.
> 
> Large corporations function much like the "Village" in Ryan Holiday's analogy, with their own norms, hierarchies, and cultures that employees navigate. Being "of the Village" in a corporate context means working within established structures to maintain stability and efficiency, while intrapreneurs act as challengers from within, innovating and pushing for change. Entrepreneurs, by contrast, leave the corporate Village entirely to create something new, often in competition with it. While employees enjoy stability and defined roles, intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs take on greater risks in pursuit of meaningful impact and innovation. This dynamic reflects the choice between being shaped by the corporate system or shaping it, either from inside as a reformer or from outside as a disruptor.

Nate Silver: I mean, there's two, I mean, one is that like before I got into the media I played poker for a living and stuff like that. Right. But yeah, if you have a more entrepreneurial bent and kind of like, I think it's a big advantage. I think like on substack you find ways to like, it's not game the system, but it's just like, you know, you have some understanding of what the value of your time is and what tends to move the numbers and what doesn't. Right.

Ryan Holiday: You're not insulated from the economics of what you do as you, by definition you are as an employee.

Nate Silver: Yeah. For years I was employed by one of the world's largest media companies, the Walt Disney Company. And no incentive based compensation like whatsoever.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah.

Nate Silver: And so it's like, okay, if I go and play in a poker tournament, which is something that I love to do.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah.

Nate Silver: Then it's kind of free, right. It's like basically you're kind of burning time on the clock now. Right. And like this year I was at the World Series of Poker, we had launched the newsletter, there's all this news, right. It's like, oh, Trump just got convicted of all these felonies, right. And I'm playing in a $1,000 buy in tournament and I'm like, if I write a post right now, the expected value of that is like a lot greater than $1,000.

Ryan Holiday: Right.

Nate Silver: So should I just punt the tournament and probably you should. Although you also get in a situation where like, I think people need constraints and like when you have a thing where you can kind of like publish a post and make, I'm not going to say how much but like there's certain topics where like. And you can't like drive yourself crazy and what are you like really maximizing for? I guess, but it's, it's very different.

Ryan Holiday: Well, especially I would say for people who are trying to think about how the sausage is made journalistically. If you're a journalist and there's always been some, somewhat of a ceiling on what you can make and journalists are like upper middle class if you are successful at it and then suddenly the economics of being your own media company where you are selling directly to consumers, suddenly it's like lots of money, potentially could be lots of money. And that can be a very wicked set of incentives operating on someone who's never who, what they write or think has never been influenced by how much it will or won't make them. And that's where obviously audience capture and stuff like that comes in.

Nate Silver: Yeah, I mean, there's kind of short run and long run. Right. I mean, like, you know, two days ago I wrote a post that was very critical of Joe Biden. Right. And even though, you know, there's no news value. Exactly. I mean, I think there's historical value in putting his stubbornness about dropping out in perspective. Right. But like, that's, you know, a post that, like, it got lots of page views, it did not convert very well to subscribers, relatively speaking. And it probably annoyed got like a lot of Kamala Friendly audience because she's been rising in the forecast.

Ryan Holiday: Sure.

Nate Silver: But in the long run, people are paying me in many cases for my uncorrelated takes and for my independent takes. And you're going to get what you're going to get. And I think that's really important. The trick is I don't like politics. I like elections. I think election forecasting are interesting problem and that it's a little gamified. And that part's fascinating. But I don't care about the State of the Union address. I have as a citizen policy preferences. I have an economics degree, but I'm not. I'm not concerned about congressional procedure, for example, or things like that, or obscure special elections that don't have any national implication. So, yeah, I'm just not going to write about it. Right. And then you also get this thing where if you have a newsletter, you either kind of just you're the brand or it's like a brand, like in the substack ecosystem, like the free press or something. Right. Where now all of a sudden it's like 35 people. And is there any in between there that kind of works? I mean, you can hire people to help you, but like, you're your own brand. Right. And like, and you can do some degree of expansion, but if you stray too far, then it undermines that undermines the quality a little bit, I think. And because you're a kind of man of contradictions in some ways. And I am too. Right.


> [!summary] Title
> The transition from traditional media roles to independent media entrepreneurship can be theorized through the lens of **agency**, highlighting the interplay between autonomy, structural constraints, and decision-making in a dynamic media ecosystem. In traditional employment, journalists operate within institutional frameworks that limit their agency; their output is shaped by editorial priorities, and their economic outcomes are detached from their individual efforts. By stepping into independent roles, creators reclaim agency, gaining control over their work, schedule, and monetization. However, this expanded autonomy introduces new challenges, such as the need to navigate opportunity costs, as every decision—whether to write a post or pursue leisure—is weighed against its potential financial or reputational value. This reflects a shift to **rational agency**, where creators optimize their time based on expected outcomes. Yet, independence comes with risks, including audience capture, where the creator’s authenticity and decisions may become overly influenced by market forces or subscriber preferences, compromising their autonomy. Moreover, as independent creators often conflate personal identity with their brand, their agency becomes deeply personal, exposing them to heightened reputational stakes. Balancing short-term performance with long-term brand integrity, as well as growth with authenticity, requires creators to exercise **adaptive agency**, continually negotiating their autonomy within an ever-evolving media landscape. This framework highlights how agency is contextual, multidimensional, and central to understanding the trade-offs of independence in modern media.
> 
> 1. **Agency and Structural Constraints**
> 	- **Traditional Employment as Limited Agency**: In traditional media roles, the individual’s agency is constrained by institutional structures. Journalists operate within a framework where salaries are fixed, content priorities are influenced by editorial boards, and the economic outcomes of their work are detached from their personal decision-making. This creates a form of bounded agency, where their autonomy is limited by their role in a larger system.
> 	- **Entrepreneurial Media as Expanded Agency**: Independent creators reclaim agency by stepping outside institutional structures. They control what they write, when they write, and how they monetize their work. However, this expanded agency comes with trade-offs, such as heightened responsibility and exposure to market forces.
> 2. **Expected Value as a Model for Decision-Making**
> 	- Rational Agency: The concept of expected value highlights how individuals make decisions based on maximizing outcomes—whether financial, reputational, or intellectual. For independent creators, every decision (e.g., writing a post, taking a break, or engaging in leisure) is weighed against its potential value. This reflects a form of rational agency, where creators continuously optimize their actions based on available data and projections.
> 	- Trade-Offs in Agency: While independent creators gain freedom, they also inherit the full burden of opportunity costs. For example, Silver’s decision to forgo leisure (poker) in favor of creating content reveals the tension between autonomy and the economic imperatives of being one’s own boss.
> 3. **Authenticity and Audience Capture**
> 	- Agency vs. External Influence: Independent creators face a unique challenge of maintaining authenticity while navigating audience preferences. The risk of audience capture—where creators prioritize what sells over what aligns with their values—illustrates the compromised agency that can arise when market forces heavily influence creative decisions.
> 	- Performative Agency: In cases of audience capture, the creator’s autonomy becomes performative rather than genuine. They may appear independent but are subtly driven by the economic incentives of subscriber conversion or engagement metrics.
> 4. Agency and Identity
> 	- Personal vs. Institutional Branding: Independent creators often conflate their personal identity with their professional output, making their brand deeply tied to their agency. This contrasts with traditional media, where individual identity is subsumed under the institution’s brand. The high personal stakes amplify the creator’s sense of agency but also expose them to greater reputational risks.
> 	- Scalability and Delegation of Agency: As Silver notes, scaling an independent brand (e.g., hiring staff or broadening content) can dilute the personal agency that defines its authenticity. Delegating tasks to others shifts the locus of agency, creating tension between growth and maintaining control.
>5. Long-Term Agency in a Dynamic Media Ecosystem
>	- Temporal Dimensions of Agency: Silver’s reflections on balancing short-term and long-term goals illustrate a temporal aspect of agency. In the short term, decisions may prioritize immediate outcomes (e.g., page views or engagement), while long-term agency is exercised by building a consistent, authentic brand that attracts loyal audiences over time.
>	- Agency as Resilience: The ability to navigate these competing pressures—financial imperatives, audience expectations, and personal values—requires resilience. Independent creators exemplify adaptive agency, continually renegotiating their autonomy in response to a dynamic media landscape.
>
>**Key Theoretical Takeaways**
>	- Agency is Contextual: The degree of agency one exercises depends on the structural environment (traditional employment vs. entrepreneurial independence) and the individual’s ability to navigate trade-offs.
>	- Agency is Multi-Dimensional: It encompasses decision-making, identity, authenticity, and resilience, all of which are influenced by external and internal factors.
>	- Agency and Risk: Expanded agency comes with increased risks—economic, reputational, and emotional. Balancing these risks while maintaining authenticity is central to exercising meaningful agency in independent media.>)

Does it mean they worked too hard?


Ryan Holiday: You know, what are my contradictions?

Nate Silver: So I don't know that much about all the stoicism. I was trying to bone up on it, but then I had all this political news, so I didn't really get to. Yeah, because on the one hand, there's a stoic side, but you're also a terrific entrepreneur. Right. Like, that's A little. I mean, maybe on some deeper vector, it all makes sense. Right. But on the surface, a little bit. A little bit of tension, I suppose. Right.

Ryan Holiday: I guess. I mean, that's the same as a sort of journalistic tension where it's like, I care about truth and information and reporting, but if it's not actionable to someone, no one would pay for it. So there's. I think there's always that. That tension. I think it's interesting, too, because, yeah, sometimes I get that about the entrepreneurial side, and then I go, like, but what about the bargains to speak of the village, which you talk a lot about in the book, Like, I'm not charging undergraduates $40,000 a year. You know what I mean? Is that somehow more ethical or less that that creates its own set of incentives, which arguably first have moral implications and then incentives, and I'm not sure they're any better, but some. Sometimes we're just used to those incentives, so they. They kind of operate in the background, and then when something new comes up, then we're, like, questioning all parts of it, even though it might actually be pure and get a better outcome.

Nate Silver: Yeah, look, I think in the long run, it converges more than in the short run. Sometimes it maybe doesn't. You know, in my career, I've always done stuff that I loved and that I worked really hard at and I thought added value and was differentiated and, you know, you're getting something you can't get anywhere else and, like, there's no tricks involved. But at the same time, if, like, you know, post A is going to make me, you know, 2x post B, and I'm otherwise indifferent or mostly indifferent, or if I'm on a flight from Seattle to Austin, I can be like, I could go and, like, relax and have a beer and listen to your podcast and things like that, or I could, like, write an important post on Kamala Harris in her convention speech, then that affects the incentives quite a bit.

Ryan Holiday: But can you turn that off? So, like, when you think, like, I'm writing this or that, are you thinking like, this is its expected return or this is the expected value? Because obviously that's partly how your mind works. I feel like I've had to work pretty hard at not thinking about that at all. Like, so I don't check stats on most things. I don't look at the replies of the. I want to have an audience rather than an audience have me.

Nate Silver: Yeah, I think I'm in a phase where the newsletter is still relatively new. I mean, the paid product's been up for less than a year. So I think it's still pretty informative to have a sense for what works better and what doesn't. But it's often hard to predict. I did a post a month ago that was just seven quick thoughts about the Kamala Harris Trump polling. Right. And it was like, I don't think it's quite dashed off. I mean, explain in a minute, right? But it took 45 minutes to actually write. I write very fast and like that got some like insane number of signups. I don't know quite why. Maybe the timing of it just hit, right? And sometimes these more informal headlines convey more honesty and like authenticity. The other thing is like, I'm always, I'm always processing stuff in the background. If you're a writer, then if you go, you know, I did a speaking gig in San Francisco, right. And sometimes on these book tours, they don't really bother to feed you very well. Right. So I went out and got some late night tacos and had a beer, right? And I'm like. But I'm thinking about articles for the next five days and processing stuff. So you're not really off the clock with creative content, I don't think. And so you're trying to like, I call it like nose to tail blogging, where if you've put X amount of effort into thinking about something, even if it's something that's not necessarily in your venue, you're thinking about, you know, why is a certain sport popular in a certain part of the country and you get really into this problem and things like that. And then like, I think she kind of use those and not let defer that you've made go to waste, you know?

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. Or metrics decide that it's not worth doing.

Nate Silver: Right. Yeah. I try to avoid having throwaway posts in an email newsletter because people will stop opening people. And we really, we have like insanely. We have 60% open rate still. Which is kind of insane. No, because like, you're pushing into someone else's space. And I don't want to have an email that if there's three things, it's like, oh, here's a link to a cool interview I did with Ryan and here's a book tour event coming up. And here's a little gimmick or something or a cool book I read.

Ryan Holiday: You have to respect the access that you have.

Nate Silver: Yeah. Because it's very different than pure web publishing. We're kind of a hybrid. Basically. Half our traffic is from the web and some people use a traditional website, but I want to respect that. The email list.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, I think about that. Although when I was thinking, when you talk about decoupling in the book, and one of the things I. One version of sort of accidental decoupling for me is like, you learn, you do it long enough, the thing you think is going to do amazing does terrible. And then the thing that you don't think is going to do well does amazing. And you sort of, you kind of learn to decouple, like sometimes your own intuition from what you do or don't do. Or you learn maybe just to actually trust the intuition and ignore the data because more often than not you're right. So it's like sort of, as you said, short term versus long term sort of evaluations of things.

Nate Silver: The thing that really took the product off was actually not politics stuff, but the NCAA basketball model. And like it was a Sunday. Yeah, I didn't have too busy a day, but I'm like, I bet if I spent all day on this, I could get like the NCAA basketball model revive. But is it worth it? It'd be really nice to have kind of a mental day off. I just did finish the book. Right. And then, then you do it. And then like by the time I'm going down my driveway, you're like adding like dozens of. It's just kind of crazy. And I had no idea that there was that much demand for it until you do it and you experiment.

Ryan Holiday: Well, I thought the Peter Thiel stuff was fascinating in the book and I think you asked me for his email. Am I. Is that.

Nate Silver: You did? Yeah. I wasn't sure who. And that was actually like a door opening interview for me. Right. In the original proposal for the book, there was a lot more about Wall Street. I mean, I'm based in New York and I thought like, oh, a hedge fund or something is like a more direct analogy as you're moving out of poker and sports betting and things like that. But the VCs were interested in talking to me and they're interesting people, right. I mean, they're more multifaceted than the hedge fund guys. The hedge fund guys are like, I have hedge fund friends. Right. But they're a little bit more, I don't know, somewhere on the spectrum sometimes. And also they're guarded because they understand that there are a finite number of $20 bills lying on the street and they don't want someone else to pick them up. Whereas VCs kind of want some degree of contagion for Their ideas.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, the Wall street guys seem to be like, this is how to make the numbers go up. Or like it's a math oriented thing where with the VC ones that I've met, it's a philosophical approach to it as much as it's a data driven financial.

Nate Silver: Yeah, I mean, I think, I don't think they are particularly materialistic. Exactly. You go to rich people's homes in Silicon Valley and they're kind of low key and understated. It's not Hollywood. It's not a penthouse apartment in Central Park, New York or something like that. Ironically, I think they're kind of irrational on some level. If you have basically reached a point where you have infinite money and you keep competing, you're doing it for the love of the game is maybe a more charitable way to put it. Or cause something in your DNA or your upbringing causes you just have this intrinsic property to always battle, always battle, always battle.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, yeah, that's what. It's like Peter's thing. I watched this interview with Seinfeld once and he was saying that a comedian is like a woodchuck. You don't know why they chuck wood, they just do it. And it's like, do you just have this thing that you can't turn off? And he strikes me as like a theorizing machine. Like he can't not come up with theories about why things are the way that they are. And then he happened to have joined that with investing in said theories. Like Eric Weinstein, who was much more of a sane figure when he told me this, said that he thinks Peter Thiel is the world's richest applied philosopher. And I was like, oh, yeah, that kind of. I think that's also kind of how he sees himself.

Nate Silver: I think one of the ways in which people are lucky is that you come along at times when certain skill sets happen to be really rewarded. Right. And on a much smaller scale than Peter Thiel. I have this weird overlap of skills that in the exact way the media industry is working with these newsletters in 2024 plus you have a book coming out which was supposed to come out a year and a half ago. Right. We wouldn't intend to have this whole cluster bomb approach where the podcast and the book and the newsletter all launch at once. It was supposed to be staggered so I could transition out of politics. But then you have this election turns out to be really interesting. Right. It was gonna be deathly boring. Biden versus Trump. And every poll is plus one Trump or plus one Biden for months Then you have this much more dynamic campaign. Yeah, but if something like that happens, you have to be like, this is very much being in the right place at the right time several times over, really.

Ryan Holiday: But Peter Thiel doesn't believe in only cause and effect.

Nate Silver: Yeah, maybe I do think it's. I think maybe it's. In some ways he's a little bit more at peace with himself. Because if you are like Elon Musk or any reasonably successful VC and you're like, I am in the 0.0000001%. I mean, one of the 20 richest people out of the 80 billion people have ever lived, it gets a little bit weird, right? You're like, how am I so the center of my own narrative as much? And especially if you're a little bit. If you are independent minded and you have this kind of great life, then I think it gets a little weird and you maybe start having to ask some from a Bayesian, if I won the World Series of Poker, if I finished fifth or something, then that would be normal.

Ryan Holiday: It wouldn't change you that much.

Nate Silver: But if I won, I'd be like, is this really happening? You know what I mean? It would be a little bit weird. You wonder, is there some type of simulation or is there some type of intervention? I think as a Bayesian, you start to have to ask questions like those a little bit.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. But I would wonder if the explanation is a bit more simple. So you have some theories about the universe, they make you billions of dollars because they were interesting, or you made for a couple good interviews. You also develop kind of a public following, or you sought out a public following. Like, there's plenty of VCs that are incredibly successful and nobody knows their names for sure and they don't tweet a lot and they don't want an audience. But so you already have the proclivity of sort of wanting the recognition you need to be the smartest guy in the room. And now you're basically only hearing from people that want something from you or are attracted to you because they think you're brilliant. And so like I. And then. And then let's add on top of this, the toxicity that is the sort of Twitter algorithm. If what you do is like, spew out theories. And that's what they do. They're like, well, what about this? Maybe this is going to happen. Here's where the future is going. And early on, people would say, that's crazy, or that's what about this and what it more and More you're only hearing from people that say that's brilliant. I think those theories are going to get weirder and weirder because I've gone.

Nate Silver: Through different epicycles of this where your status waxes and wanes. And for media I've had a lot of longevity and yeah, absolutely, you kind of. Right now I'm in an upcycle and have more opportunities than ever. And now it's relatively new again and it feels good. But I'm very afraid that because there are guys that just kind of get lost in their rich person shit, right? Where they're like, they're never going to have any real criticism. If they do, they have infinite optionality to move on to something else. And there's kind of no touching grass and no reality check. And how do you avoid that? I mean, believe me, it's the better problem to have than the other way around. Right. But if you see yourself and also if you are looking at a newsletter or looking at book sales where you actually have data. Right. Like okay, I am right now, as we're talking in this exponential phase which will inevitably end. And in fact in my case, because we're very seasonal, will reverse. Right. So if you're running the lobster boat truck in Maine selling lobster rolls and you're going to be busy in August. Right?

Ryan Holiday: Yeah.

Nate Silver: You can't extrapolate that to 12 months a year.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. One of my theories of Peter is Peter Thiel is fascinated by Rene Girard, but Rene Girard's theories are nonsense and people only like him because Peter Thiel likes them. Which of course proves Gerard's theories. Like there's something about the effect of being powerful and important and right about some big things that makes it hard to. Then like my friend was saying the other day that having a contrarian theory that turns out to be correct can be a brain destroying experience. And how do you think about that with some of these figures and people you talk about where it's like they were the 1 out of 100 and so 99% of the population was wrong and now they have a view that's insane or stupid or weird. And the same 99 are saying that's stupid or weird. It feels exactly the same way as last time.

Nate Silver: It's very intoxicating. Right. You know the most intoxicating thing in poker is when you make a daring play. Like you call down a bluff in a spot where ordinarily you're not supposed to call according to the game theory. Right. Or you make a really big bet for Value because someone thinks you're bluffing and you extract a huge pot, but you're supposed to win a small pot instead, right?

Ryan Holiday: Yeah.

Nate Silver: So the combination of, like, the validation from being right and then also winning a lot of money from it, those two, like, stimulus at the same time, that's very intoxicating and very hard. I mean, if you play poker, the good thing is you do reach the long run. You've had great days and bad days, and you kind of simulate the world at a much quicker rate. And so you kind of learn that way. I mean, I think poker, again, I'm probably not using terms like stoicism correctly, but I think when you go to a tournament, I played the World Series of Poker. I play a lot of poker. Me, the main event, final, 100 players out of 10,000 last year, 2013. And by the time you get to day six, which is as far as I made it, every hand is worth the equivalent of a couple hundred thousand dollars in expected value. And I had a hand where I made this good call down and then doubled my chips. So I go from having probably $200,000 in expected value in front of me to the equivalent of $400,000. And of course, you're only thinking about it. It's like, oh, it's Monopoly money, right.

Ryan Holiday: You can't just get up and walk away. In the World Series of Poker games.

Nate Silver: You could, but they would blind you off, right? So you'd just be paying a penalty. You have to play to the end of the tournament. You could leave and then you get. You'd blind off and get whatever prize you want, but you're competing for like, $12 million.

Ryan Holiday: But it's not like a regular casino where you can take your winnings and be like, I'm good.

Nate Silver: Well, even in, like, you know, the best spots in poker are probably high stakes, private cash games. Right? And even then, you know, you play a game and you have like a really good. Often they're like six hours long or something. You play a game and you have like a really good first three hours. There are lots of times to be like, I just want to go home and get a nice dinner or something. Right? But I mean, that's considered, like, bad etiquette and you wouldn't be invited back to the game. So it's actually a similar dynamic in high stakes cash, in regular cash, in a casino where it's open invitation to anybody, then you don't have that dynamic. You can quit, and you often should quit, probably because there's winners Tilt. It's called when you're on a winning streak. People think, oh, tilt is when you take a bad beat or you're on a losing streak and you're emotionally distressed about it. But winners tilt when you think you're God's gift to poker or sports betting or venture capital or media, entrepreneurship or whatever else is very toxic as well.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, that makes sense. I was always really reluctant to have employees. It seemed like a big headache and so when I could early on I tried to do everything myself and then we worked with freelancers at first, but as Daily Stoic started to succeed and we hired people, once I did hire people, I wanted to make sure I did it right and I wanted to make sure those employees had benefits.

Like, I think about this when I went to my publisher and I was like, I want to write a book about an obscure school of ancient philosophy. They were like, what? Yeah, you know, and then so it worked. And fundamentally all entrepreneurs have some version of this dilemma which is like you did a thing that wasn't supposed to be possible that everyone said wasn't going to work. And so do you take from that like don't listen to other people or that you are a genius? The story you tell yourself coming out of having defied odds is a pivot point in your life.

Nate Silver: I mean I think there is some kind of social intelligence and kind of reading what's on the periphery of the acceptable. Right. That could become mainstream. I think there's, I think there's got to be some skill there. I don't think it's totally random.

Ryan Holiday: No, no, I don't think it's random. It's just like, but thinking about it that way versus like I can predict the future. I'm a trend maker. I will this into the story you tell yourself determines like does Google see itself as this revolutionary world changing company? Or they're like, hey, we bought YouTube. That turned out to work good. And then Gmail was this internal experiment that worked out okay. Your story about yourself is going to determine how you interpret risk in the future and how you estimate your own capacities and competencies.

Nate Silver: Look, I do believe that life experiences teaches you a lot, which I think was a cliche. But for some people, they have a hugely high motor in their 20s and 30s and then they settle down, which is a normal healthy thing to do. But the thing they learn in their 20s and 30s, they're no longer able to apply those lessons in a higher leverage way. Whereas if you've had nine lives in media, then I still have as much energy intellectually as ever and I know where I fucked things up and can course correct. And you just develop over time like different types of skills. I think I've gone from more introverted to more extroverted. And if you have your intuition, this is a big lesson for poker too. If you have lots of experience, lots of data, then your intuition is extremely valuable. Right? The problem people make is like when they're in a novel situation that they have no experience in or no good direct analogy for, then their intuition sucks, right? They should slow down and be more rigorous about a problem like Covid people don't think very well about exponentials and how they work. So it's like, okay, well, let's have, like, Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York at the time, was like, we're going to have to shut things down for a little bit, so go have, like, one big blowout at the bar.

Ryan Holiday: Did you worked out like, the day before? Like, yeah, yeah.

Nate Silver: Like, that's like, literally the worst time possible to do it.

Ryan Holiday: Right.

Nate Silver: That is going to offset, like, weeks and weeks of social distancing, whatever you call it. And like, people's intuitions don't. Don't grasp that. I don't think.

Ryan Holiday: Or just, hey, everyone, let's fly home. Like, everyone fly home on the same planes from those countries just to think the ability. Yeah, well, I think you have. So it's like you have your intuition and in some cases, getting stronger, and then you're also going to be finding yourself in novel situations like that. Physicist John Wheeler talked about how, like, as your island of knowledge grows, so does the shoreline of ignorance. So you're going to be bumping up into stuff. And so that's where ego is such a problem. Because ego says, like, well, whatever you intuitively felt, it served you well. All these points. Like, you talk about Musk in the book and Peter. I've heard Peter talk about this, but, like, Musk as this guy who just goes all in. Both. Both in poker, but also with his companies. So there's some version where Elon Musk. This sounds very dismissive because he's obviously a genius in many ways, but it's like he's gone all in on each one of his companies and not blown up. That doesn't mean it was a good idea. It just means he didn't blow up each of those times. And in invariably one of the times.

Nate Silver: It will blow up invariably. Although he has, I think, many, many levels he could fall through before he gets too much trouble. Yeah, look, I mean, again, I mean, a lot of the book's about poker, so I don't feel too guilty about going back to the analogies there. In poker, you actually get enough data to calibrate. Right. If I'm saying, Ryan, I know I have a really weak hand, but it just feels to me like you're bluffing.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah.

Nate Silver: And maybe I can kind of semi articulate that and semi not. You can have some metamacro tracker in your head of like, okay, it seems like of all the times I make a counterintuitive play based on my intuition, I guess Therefore, it's an intuitive play, a counter math play, based on my intuition, actually, I'm making a profit on those plays. Let me steer toward doing that more often. And then sometimes, especially if you've been on a winning streak, then you go overboard, then you're like, oh, I'm going to make this really unusual play. It's like where the math just doesn't support it at all or you misread an opponent. Because in poker, signals are ambiguous, right? Some players get very nervous when they're bluffing. Some players are actually very calm when they're bluffing and get very nervous when they have like the opportunity to win a huge pot with a good hand. They have aces, they can't control their heartbeat or whatever. And so like you can pick up a signal but interpret it wrongly where it's actually the opposite signal from what you think.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, the thing about poker is you're getting lots of reps with similar situations and, yeah, mathematical situations. Whereas, like, think about it. So it's, you had some intuition from your first book, then you have intuition, the experience of your second book. But like, even if you live for a long time and write a lot more books, like three, four, five more reps, like, that's the tricky thing about life is that you don't. Like I just interviewed yesterday, I interviewed Francis Ford Coppola and he went all, he basically went all in on this, like, movie that he's doing. Like, he sold his wine company. He's like betting everything on this movie. And if you saw that, like the last trailer, like the trailer is like all the negative reviews for his other movies. And he's basically saying, like, the critics have always been wrong, the early reviews for this new movie haven't been good, but just like, let's just wait. And so it's like, that could be true, but it's not like he has, like, it's not like he's done it a thousand times because it's so hard to do a movie. So that would be. So like, when are you actually making a data or probabilistic decision and when are you just fooling yourself that you are?

Nate Silver: You know, with books in particular. I mean, books actually have this kind of exponential success curve a little bit. And like with books, I mean, they can always totally flop, Right. I was talking with a very well known author who's very successful. He's like, you never in a lot of books and like, you've probably never heard of three of them. Right? Because three of them totally bombed and you know.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. Michael Lewis has a book that no one's heard of because it came out like on September 11th.

Nate Silver: Oh, that's funny. Yeah. So books, you inherently, I mean, anytime you have a book, even have. I only had two, so now I'm being ridiculous by trying to generalize from it.

Ryan Holiday: But that's what I mean. It's hard because the thing is so big. And like you even think about this with some of the entrepreneurs you talk about in the book, like they founded one company or two companies and then so you're generalizing from this experience, but it's not that much experience given the immensity of the possible experiences.

Nate Silver: Yeah, look, I am interested in reading about the business of the media broadly. Right. And I'm talking to other people who are and, and just kind of doing case studies. It's not necessarily where you apply lesson A from point X to point Z or whatever, but I just think being a little bit immersed in that, and I guess I'm not afraid to admit that I like games of strategy. You know what I mean? I think it's a good product. I think it's a really good product. I worked my ass off. I've been up for. I mean, I took a little bit of rest this morning, but why not figure out ways to market it? Well, it's like you go to a restaurant and you're like, you have this worst fucking name. You have great food, but you have the stupidest fucking name in the history of the world. Right?

Ryan Holiday: Yeah.

Nate Silver: And you're on the street that gets no foot traffic, whereas for 10% more rent, you can go to the street across the block where they get tons of foot traffic. And it's like you just want to like, come on.

Ryan Holiday: Like, you made a bunch of decisions. Even if luck has a lot to do with it, you made a bunch of decisions that were like, objectively constraining or self defeating.

Nate Silver: Yeah. As a creative, if you're not willing to market yourself, maybe you don't care. Right. Maybe you just are totally non materialistic and you find a small audience and you go to some independent bookstores and you live a good life and that's fine. Right. But I think creatives need to get better at the business side of things.

Ryan Holiday: But that's the hard part is, so if you're a novelist, you might write five novels in your life, so you can't get that much experience. I got very lucky because I was in marketing before and then I worked in book marketing, so I got to run the campaigns on a bunch of books. Like, I did both Will MacAskill's books. So all different kinds of books, all different genres. People with platforms, not with platforms, famous people, not famous people. So I could like, see be involved in decisions that, like where you're supposed to have skin in the game. But it was nice to not have skin in the game. Like, I got to learn from other people's experiences, so sort of widen my data set. But yeah, you make people make a lot of dumb decisions. They wrote the book because it's exciting to them and they didn't think, like, well, how is this actually going to be relevant to people? Or why would anyone have you come talk talk to their employee? Like, you should write about the thing because you're interested in it. You should make the movie about it because you're passionate, whatever it is. But if you haven't also sat down and thought, like, how is this going to play to people? Why is it relevant? Why is it going to work? All of those things, you've made it unlikely that you're going to be that successful.

Nate Silver: And the mistake of extrapolating from the line going up must keep going up. So the one smart thing I'll give myself credit for for this book, because I reread the proposal, right? Proposals in February, March 2021. We're still emerging from the pandemic. All the books are about how bad Trump is or about racial equity and things like that, or gender equity, things.

Ryan Holiday: Like that, whatever the trends of the moment were, right?

Nate Silver: And I'm like, look, people are going to get sick and tired of this stuff, especially with Biden in the White House for after two or three more years. So having a book that's unexpected and fun, so you kind of predicting a vibe shift in the desire for consuming politically adjacent.

Ryan Holiday: Well, you also have to think about the way books work, which is books have the longest shelf life of any of the forms of entertainment, right? Or one of the longest shelf lifes. And so a lot of people write books that are very much of the moment, even though the curve for adoption for a book, like, how many. Like you ask people, like, what was the last book you preordered? Or what was the last book you read like, even within the month that came out. Like, I always get around to books, like, unless I'm interviewing the person like a year later, two years later. So if you chose to write about something that's not going to last for a minimum of one year, you've already eliminated a huge chunk of its potential audience, right? And so people don't really think about those. Those things. And as they just make creative decisions when they really needed to make creative decisions that were then weighing some of the stuff you talk about with like risk and expected value, just a slightly different decision or a different way of positioning it could have allowed the thing to last for 10 years as opposed to 18 months.

Nate Silver: And we're in Austin, so the home of slow cooked barbecue. There's probably a technical term for it that boiling process or the slow cooking process allows certain things to happen that you see worlds evolve, you see narratives actually get tied together in unexpected ways. Sam Bakeman Fried is maybe one of the most important figures in the book. Was not even on my initial list in 2021. His entire rise and fall happens in the timeframe of the book. Or like someone like Sam Altman, where I talked to Sam in August 2022 when they kind of knew behind the scenes that like GPT 3.5 and 4 are going to be really cool, but they're not as high profile. Right.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah.

Nate Silver: And so later I tried to re interview him and he's like, you know, the biggest, busiest man in the world. We do a little bit by email. I'm like, actually this is much given the choice to have an interview after the breakout or kind of in the middle of their process when he's less guarded in August 2022. This interview is actually much better, the one I already had in the bag. So things like that are helpful with the book.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, yeah. You never know where things are going to go. But if you are trying to think of optionality as opposed to locking things in, you have more.

Nate Silver: Well, that's the other kind. I feel like if you understand optionality, that might be the single most important skill if you're anywhere in entrepreneurial mindset. Right. That cultivating opportunities that lead to more opportunities instead of nodes that are closed is just this incredibly, incredibly valuable, exponentially better skill set. Right. And it might mean saying yes to more things to more. You know, I think about how I've made friends then it's often through some friend of a friend you met at a party that you didn't actually want to go to that night or something. Right. But you just want to like. Like you want to go where doors are likely to open and lead to other doors. And if you don't do that, then I think you're making a big mistake.

Ryan Holiday: I struggle with that because obviously to be good at something, you have to say no to things a lot and be disciplined and at the same time When I think about the things like I met my book agent and some of my best friends at like a conference I went to like 12 years ago and I wasn't going to go, and then I went, and then now I spend most of my time trying to not go to conferences. You know, these random serendipitous things change your, the course, the trajectory of your life. And also though, if you went to all of them, you would never have time to do what you do. And so how do you let that randomness in without being ruled by it?

Nate Silver: So one thing that helps me a lot, it's kind of unique circumstance, is because elections are these four year cycles, you naturally have up cycles and down cycles, right? So you're going at warp speed in the June through November of an election year, and the other seven out of eight times throughout the rest of the year, then you can pick your pace.

Ryan Holiday: A little bit more interesting. One of the things I was curious about in the book, it seems like these VC guys, what they're really good at is realizing, okay, you can only lose the amount of money you put in, but you could potentially make an unlimited amount of money. So they developed this mindset of taking these chancy bets. I'm wondering if part of the world we're living in is their struggle to realize that most things in life are not that way for sure.

Nate Silver: I think they, you know, things like, their intuitions about politics tend not to be very good. You know, Peter Thiel's a smart political thinker, but like, the candidates that he's kind of endorsed tend not to sell very well to mainstream America necessarily.

Ryan Holiday: But I think it's more, what I'm saying is like, okay, so Peter, and, and I sense this very much when I was writing the book, because I remember I was in his office the day he announced that he was donating that first money to Trump. And I remember sort of asking him what he was doing and he was like, well, you know, it could work, you know, and it ultimately did work and that Trump was elected. But I think he was thinking about it, it's like, okay, it's only a million and a half dollars, which is something only a billionaire would say. And someone who has a sense of how much money gets thrown in politics, that, that seems like not a lot of money. But he's thinking like, all I can do is lose this money. But actually what happens is that donation, just like the Gawker thing, you know, he's like, hey, I'll spend $10 million. Who knows what happens? Well, it also changes the trajectory of his life in the sense that, like, I don't think the Trump thing would have happened without the Gawker thing. And I don't think being right about the Trump thing, if he had not made that bet, I think being right about something can radicalize you. It changes the people you spend time with. It changes how the world sees you. I know he wasn't thinking about what other people would think because that's not how he thinks. And yet you end up having to live with your reputation and your place in the world every day.

Nate Silver: Yeah. If people who aren't doing the kind of meta rationality stuff don't realize the extent to which, I mean, when I started writing and tweeting more about COVID where, I don't know, I think I actually have a very centrist viewpoint. Right. I thought the lockdowns were bad. I think the vaccines are good. Right. I thought we had to get back to normal at some point after vaccines were available. But yeah, when you identify of a certain political bent and you're more outspoken about things, then the people that you meet change in types of subtle ways. Right. It's not like I've ever had a friend, like maybe one cancel me over politics, but it just kind of changes your trajectories a little bit. And if you don't realize it, then, I mean, the other thing too is, look, I think if you have a general bias, the average person is too conformist.

Ryan Holiday: Yes.

Nate Silver: But you see people in Silicon Valley and these different sub communities and the rationalist community where maybe they have some successes and they just go away overboard or maybe they're living their great life, I don't know. But yeah, that first succulent taste of success by making a contrarian bet and having it be right is very, I think, addictive.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, it's addictive. And then, yeah, it's changing the reality you're in. But I remember he said something like, and I don't mean to make this all about him, you could do this with Mark Andreessen or Ackman or whatever, but he said something, he was like, the Trump thing, he's like, there's a 20% or 30% chance this could all end in disaster, but whatever. And so it's like, if you're betting on a company going like, there's a high chance of success, that failure is capped at zero. It's great. But the presidency ending in disaster is one of the possibilities. There is nuclear holocaust. You need a balance of the swashbuckling risk taker. And that attitude is particularly conducive and successful in places conducive to it. And then there's this other part of our world where I'm not sure you want to introduce the river mentality.

Nate Silver: Yeah. I mean, part of it too was having some meta rationality about where are the weak points in your mental model and how fragile are they. This sounds like Taleb a little bit more. But yeah, if sometimes you're making a model like an election model, which is pretty complex. Right. There's several thousand lines of code and you'll focus so much on some very small detail like the second Congressional district of Nebraska, which awards one electoral. Right. But then some very major parameter like. Like how much error do we expect there to be in the polls? You just estimate really quickly. Or there are bugs in your code. Every year I go through and kind of not really rewrite the code, but go through and say, is there anything I should change? And you discover like, oh, there was a minus sign where there should have been a plus sign. Right. And that's a very minor operation. Doesn't matter. But it's been there for 12 years now and affected anything. But you have to be. Yeah. People, I think, are. They focus on the parts of the problems that are like nerds sniped. Right. Where they're like, they're fun and intricate and interesting and don't zoom out. And that's kind of where some of the skill comes in. And I think if you actually have experience having skin in the game and gambling or doing things adjacent or analogous to gambling, that makes you a lot better. The pure academics are almost always really bad at modeling.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. Because they don't live in the real world. I mean, is there anything less real than tenure?

Nate Silver: I don't know. Maybe. I mean, you have.

Ryan Holiday: I can see its value. I'm just saying, like, there's something inherently like we're accepting that the people we want to think about our world, we give them a kind of career where they exist in a different reality than 90% of them.

Nate Silver: Yeah, maybe we should. I mean, it's a life. Same with the Supreme Court.

Ryan Holiday: Yes. Yes.

Nate Silver: Appointments, right.

Ryan Holiday: Yes.

Nate Silver: Like, maybe we should have like five year grants of tenure where you have five years, like a MacArthur grant that's sponsored by, you know, University of Texas or whatever. Where you have five years where you can't be fired for any reason except for like, whatever. Severe crimes, felonies.

Ryan Holiday: Sure.

Nate Silver: And you can do whatever you want. There's no obligation. And maybe these are awarded by some type of weighted lottery. So, you know, maybe you have some people who you wouldn't think are obvious candidates who get one and some people who are more obvious or whatever else. And, like, that might be valuable for society, I think. I mean, the teal funds for, like, kids to drop out of college is kind of a little bit trollish, but has produced some good.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. Bunch of incredibly successful, interesting people.

Nate Silver: Yeah. I do think we're still on a trajectory away from interesting stuff happening in the academy. I mean, AI is happening almost entirely outside of academia and outside of government, for that matter. Really? I don't know what the DoD is doing or whatnot. That's pretty interesting.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. The idea of, well, we don't have this because, I don't know, you have 10 years so the government can't persecute you, but are there that many academics doing work interesting enough that the government. Government would persecute you? Do you know what I mean? They're inherently kind of not super transgressive. It's mostly people saying the same things.

Nate Silver: Yeah, I mean, look, the most interesting philosophical movement in academia is probably effective altruism, but they have what you're responsible for, I guess, now, in part. Right. They have really good marketing.

Ryan Holiday: Yes.

Nate Silver: They have really good engagement with the outside world, and they're kind of, like, straddling these lines a little bit more. And, yeah, the pure academic stuff, I mean, look, I think there are some course corrections. The fact that you have schools re requiring standardized tests, I think is probably good and things like that.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. The effective altruism thing is really interesting because I really like Will MacAskill, and I think his work's important. But it was fascinating to watch the difference between the first book and the second book. Just how much money they had to throw at the book. Like, the first time they were like, okay, we got this little marketing budget. What could we do? And we came up with a bunch of interesting ideas. And then the second one, we'd get on these phone calls, and they'd be like, well, what if we just bought a million copies? And I was like, well, definitely don't do that. Like, doesn't your thing say that if you have, what, $25 million to spend, you should save hundreds of thousands of lives in Africa and not buy books? But they were like, but if we get the ideas out in the world and then it spread, you know, our ability, our mind's ability to, like, corrupt itself and find ways to do what ultimately just assages the ego or makes us feel important or win recognition is just such a fascinating force to watch it happen to. Supposedly these hyper rational and fundamentally decent human beings who want to make a positive difference. They went from like save the child drowning in a puddle or you know, eradicate malaria to like thought experiments about AI a thousand years from now.

Nate Silver: No, I think EA and maybe utilitarians in general wind up in this very weird space where like, sometimes you're supposed to do politics, sometimes you're not. Right. Remember when like I agree that Will is like a very thoughtful person who is a smart guy who wants to.

Ryan Holiday: Do good and has done good, like done good more than most people who talk about doing good. Just like from his own salary, donations.

Nate Silver: Yeah, but it's a bit like, okay, so Tyler Cowan asked him about abortion and personally I'm pro choice, so it's not a concern for me. But if you're concerned about future life forms, which his book is all about, how can we maximize the happiness of future utilitarians in the world? Right. Then abortion becomes complicated from that framework and he's like, oh no, oh no. It's a woman's right to choose. Of course, of course. And you can kind of rationalize it, but I think it's probably a little bit inconsistent. But then you can say, oh, well, I need. Most of my donors are liberals or center left and they're very, you know, and they're very pro choice. And we already have a woman problem in ea, so I can't be like pro life. And so on some grander level and it becomes just kind of like there's no there there on some level. You know what I mean?

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. It's a moving target that they get to define, I guess.

Nate Silver: Yeah. Which is why I think you can't have like, I don't think pure utilitarianism. I think it falls apart on some grander level. Right. It falls apart. Without some constraints or principles that you establish.

My dad works in B2B marketing.

Nate Silver: He came by my school for Career.

Ryan Holiday: Day and said he was a big roas man.

Nate Silver: Then he told everyone how much he.

Ryan Holiday: Loved calculating his return on ad spend. My friends still laugh at me to this day.

Ryan Holiday: In retrospect, I think you end up the more I kind of think about the founders, the more impressed I am with the complexity of the checks and balances that they came up with in such a short amount of time. Because yeah, we see these movements happen, whether it's EA or I don't know, like Wikipedia or then you see these things happen and then how quickly just like human nature manages to find whatever the vulnerability is. So EA is like it's this great pure thing. It's struggling and then they get the money they always wanted and that money, like in some ways just breaks the whole thing because they just didn't have Black Lives Matter is another good example where it's like they just get hundreds of millions of dollars. And because what they actually wanted was not clear to themselves, they were actually harmed by the influx of support and money and the internal contradictions of the movement, but then also the personality flaws of the people at the head of it. Eventually it just collapses under its own weight.

Nate Silver: Yeah, the obsession with scale, which is partly something you can blame the VCs for, is like businesses in Europe. Classically you just have one manufacturer of Parmesan cheese that makes the best Parmesan cheese in their region of Italy for 500 years.

Ryan Holiday: Paragon Symbols has been in business since the 11th century. Yeah, that's a great business.

Nate Silver: And we don't tend to appreciate that type of business in America as much, especially in the content to bring it back to our field. Right. I think VCs tend to analogize media startups like tech companies, when it's more like running a restaurant. Right. You can run one really nice restaurant if you're very lucky. You can even franchise that to a couple of locations and you can write a cookbook and you can do one, you know, Iron Chef or whatever. But there's not like this 100x scale unless you, unless you want to be Chipotle or something, which is fine. Right.

Ryan Holiday: Or you spin off Shake Shack from Danny Meyers thing.

Nate Silver: Yeah.

Ryan Holiday: And they're not part of the same.

Nate Silver: Danny, There are exceptions. Right. You know, David Chang or Danny Meyer. Right. Are people that have managed to kind of keep a high quality product and they have their flagships and they have their expansion, but they're, you know, but they're kind of like once in a generation geniuses.

Ryan Holiday: Pretty much. Yeah. No, that's an interesting point. The New York Times is a family owned company and that's probably, that's interesting. It's publicly traded, but family owned. And that check balance has worked. Although the Washington Post is in trouble because it's just all owned by one guy.

Nate Silver: Yeah. I mean, look, I think we're probably moving toward winner take all in everything. Right. And the Times, I think is becoming like a winner take all media company. But to their credit, they have become. I had kind of a bad falling out with the Times when I left. Right. But they brought me back in to do op EDS with them and be in their podcasts and things like that. And so they're not holding a grudge because they're like, yeah, we're the best media brand in the world right now and we're not going to worry about having grudges if it makes our product better and we have more interesting content. So I think, yeah, they become a uniquely well run business, I think. But it's also the treadmill of human capital, or the accelerator of human capital, where once you start to do well, then you develop better context and hire better talent. Right. And then at some point it stops. I mean, you know, the reason why like the Xerox Corporation didn't become the dominant Google of today is because you do develop these encumbrances where, you know, the founders lose their motivation and then, you know, with every node of management that you add, then you just become a lot slower about things. And like, I'm thinking about this stuff because like like the snoozler is now doing kind of insanely well and I have one part time employee and then my partner helps out de facto, two part time employees basically. Right. And we're beating all these Companies with like 30 employees and things like that.

Ryan Holiday: And it's like the discipline to not scale is actually really interesting. Like Robert Greene talks about it via Machiavelli. But the idea of not going past the mark you aimed for and just be like, I wanted to run a newsletter, I wasn't trying to start a multimedia company. And to like, I've had to really go like, yeah, I want this to just be about this big and to put a ceiling on what you're doing. To turn down money is a really hard thing. Especially if a VC person is offering you no strings attached money. But there are strings attached.

Nate Silver: No, it's like. So I call it like the dessert analogy where like you'll go in and you have your dinner and you're like, I'm not going to have dessert. I know how to satiate myself with my main course. Right. But the person selling dessert, that is the waiter, they know that you're kind of full and they know how to say, oh, here's a dessert that sounds light. It's just some strawberries and cream or something. Right? Or why don't you indulge? Why don't you? You deserve it. I know that it's an indulgence, but now it's time to indulge. Or there's something fruity. You're like, so they always kind of are savory.

Ryan Holiday: You're gonna feel bad afterwards. But yeah.

Nate Silver: So you have to be prepared for the fact that people. It's like whenever there's a big scandal where everyone's emails get leaked, Sony Corporation or something, it's like, yeah, my expectations, there's probably some pretty bad shit in there, right? So the fact that you identify some particular bad shit doesn't really change my priors very much.

Ryan Holiday: But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. To just be like, hey, I'm willing to stay, like wework is a really good idea.

Nate Silver: Yeah.

Ryan Holiday: It's not a $40 billion idea for sure. And it shouldn't be in every city and they don't need 50 buildings in every city. But like, yeah. So the discipline to be like, I'm gonna have an extremely profitable. Interesting. This is. That takes a lot of discipline. Especially if you're surrounded by lots of people who don't have discipline.

Nate Silver: Yeah. Maybe you need some VC firms that focus on that. I mean, maybe Y Combinator is kind of a little bit there. They seem to be more okay with.

Ryan Holiday: But they're investing really early, hoping you become one of those companies and then their 1% becomes worth like a trillion dollars.

Nate Silver: Yeah, it's hard. I mean, this is one of the things too is like the inevitability in a capitalist system where people are in an independent minded country. The inevitability is that there's going to be competition and you can't turn that off. And so you may as well compete. Figure out what you want, but you may as well compete. Or you just get trampled, you're just screwed. It's a capitalist system kind of in an evolutionary way, attempts to rein that in inherently don't seem to work well and, or substantially lower human welfare.

Ryan Holiday: But to go to your casino metaphor, you have to have the ability to win money and then walk away.

Nate Silver: Yeah. Which most people don't because you know.

Ryan Holiday: It'S going to go away if you don't.

Nate Silver: Yeah. Yeah.

Ryan Holiday: That's the heart. Yeah. The other thing I thought was interesting, you were talking about this in the book, like, because there's lots to critique in the Village, but the idea of peer review or a culture of criticism. I was on this text thread with a bunch of like some of the people in your book and the degree to which they were always complaining about media coverage of them that they interpreted as extremely negative, which a normal person like me would go, no, your company's worth $8 billion. This is like, this is actually very nice coverage. This is like, this is the expected coverage when you are not the underdog anymore. And so you noted that there is kind of a culture of like. Like we're all supposed to root for each other. And that's not one how the world works, nor is it ultimately the way the world should work.

Nate Silver: No. When you go from underdog to established incumbent, I mean, that can switch very quickly. Right. And I've experienced that. And you see people turn on you, not in a personal way. I mean, I have loyal friends and I'm loyal to my friends, but the kind of general zeitgeist, whatever you want to call it can. Like.

Ryan Holiday: Like you're a news story now.

Nate Silver: Yeah. So Garrett Adelstein's a poker player who was involved in this famous scandal where he accused another player of cheating. Right. And he was like, beloved. And he's a sensitive guy. Right. He's talked about his battles with depression and things like that. And he's like, I couldn't handle with now being perceived as the villain. Because I went maybe overboard in accusing a player who might have cheated before there was proof. And that's very difficult.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, like the idea that Silicon Valley, it's like you guys are all rooting for each other. Not because it's like this love of the weird and the innovative or whatever, it's that you're all invested in each other and there's some element of a hype, like a pump and dump thing that's going on here that's accusing them of criminality in a way that they're not. But they are all incentivized to inflate the valuations of their companies. And then they're like surprised that the New York Times or random, like a 20 something, you know, reporter in New York City who's just tweeting about stuff is not equally incentivized to help them inflate the values of their company. It's like they're doing their job. And the inability to grasp that and then also to see the good that comes from like, if Silicon Valley had been exposed to more criticism Internally, maybe the WeWork thing doesn't happen.

Nate Silver: Yeah, look, you can always have overcompensation. I think the tech press was kind of very friendly to tech in like the Obama era. And then things started to shift. And some of it's unfair. I mean, I think, like, I'm not a giant fan of like the company Facebook or Meta, I suppose kind of a neutral opinion, but I think they were unfairly accused of like the whole Trump Russian bot thing was a very minor story that kind of got blew up and meme ified a little bit. But yeah, I mean, most of these people are doing exceptionally well and don't need to worry about the haters so much. But if you're someone like an Elon Musk who was very popular in both the river and the village because it's like electric cars and rocket ships and things like that safely, since they're left when people turn on you, then you can just kind of lose your shit. Right?

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, I'm fascinated by that. I'm writing about in the book that I'm doing now. And it's extra interesting because he like moved into this little town, like not the Tesla factory is just on the other side of Bastrop county and Travis county. But like in this little town, like SpaceX, boring company Starlink is here. He's moving all of Twitter's customer service here. He like owns this town now, which was like not the case, like just a few years ago. It wasn't the case. I've been here a long time. But like, it's fascinating to watch. I like that thing that came up with Trump where people say like every accusation is a confession. I think it's interesting to watch someone rail about the woke mind virus when they very clearly have caught some kind of virus, that it's utterly changed how they perceive the world and act in that world.

Nate Silver: And there are people that are more. I mean, rationality is a loaded term. But there's like, you know, Michael Moritz seems like a pretty sane and well rounded person, for example. Or you know, Vinod Khosla. Am I saying that right?

Ryan Holiday: Conway?

Nate Silver: Yeah, there are people who are quite sane and like, if you're writing. One bias that I think every author will confess to is like the subjects that are more willing to talk and that are more interesting story wise are going to get like A, overemphasized in the text originally and then B, when you do like the media for the book. Right, yeah, sure.

Ryan Holiday: That's what we're going to talk about.

Nate Silver: Elon, the two Sams, Peter Thiel and people like that. Maybe Marc Andreessen. Those are the big five bad boys, basically, even though they're not all bad.

Ryan Holiday: But what do you think about this? It does seem to be kind of a process where it's like they tweeted about this, then they tweeted about this, then they gave these comments. It's almost like it's not a cliche, but it's like I know the cycle when someone's where you're like, we call it being red pilled, I guess, but you could almost predict where and when it happens for someone.

Nate Silver: I think that there is an autoimmune response that can happen. I think what's really tricky too is that you can have the same kind of emergent behavior with things that are organic or coordinated. And it's very hard to recognize what the pathogen is. You might notice that I don't have a good example offhand. Sometimes certain phrases that may have nothing to do with anything just go through ebbs and flows of how often they're used. And that just occurs over time. Maybe you read a popular book and so you start using those phrases and there's lots of subliminal shit. But like, but also like, you know, when Penguin is dropping my book, that's a coordinated marketing campaign where we're doing 30 interviews and you know, months beforehand you've emailed influential people say, hey, you want a galley of my book? And so that's that's very non viruses. I mean it can become viral, but the spark for it is coordinated. And it's hard to tell which is which sometimes on Twitter, I think 98% of the time it's actually not coordinated. But you can get paranoid about the 2% of the time when there are. Whether it's bot farms. I mean, Ellen's obsession with bots. Right, so it's coordinated or whatever. No, it's most just like people are similar to one another and behavior is contagious and mostly it's spontaneous and organic. And the fact that there are exceptions to that, where you have media groups that are trying to shape a narrative, that can happen sometimes. And it may make sense to have a scapegoat in those times. Right. To focus on Elon or Nate Silver or Ryan Holiday, whatever else. Right. Instead of having some diffuse, diffuse focus.

Ryan Holiday: Who can embody the trend or the problem that we're talking about.

Nate Silver: Yeah, it's mostly emergent properties of inherently complex systems and the Internet.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, it's interesting to me. So you have a person who's incredibly smart, has unlimited resources, et cetera, and they're not immune from like whatever the algorithm can do to a person. Right. I just think that's so interesting.

Nate Silver: If you imagine like Nick Denton, he's like, oh, things are going kind of strangely here. Right. Maybe there is some because it sounds so paranoid.

Ryan Holiday: Yes.

Nate Silver: What if there's a secret billionaire secretly funding this lawsuit against me? I mean it sounds like completely fucking paranoid. And it probably is 95% of the time, but then he's in the 5% or the 2% when it's exactly right.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, that's true. There was an interview where somebody put it out and Peter, I remember Peter saying that they thought they'd been caught, but it was too preposterous. And so nobody believed it.

Nate Silver: Absolutely.

Ryan Holiday: So yeah, then with the time the conspiracy theorist is correct, that's the brain destroying experience. Because now you see it everywhere. I notice of the people, the people that I knew and I don't know exactly how I came to know these people, but I knew a lot of people that were in the paleo space, like the paleo diet almost to a man. They all became during the pandemic, like hyper radicalized about COVID and vaccines and whatever. And when I'm trying to be charitable to what happened, it's that they grew up with the food pyramid. And the food pyramid is bullshit and not the diet you should eat. And so there kind of was this conspiracy like to Tell people that what is healthy is unhealthy and what's unhealthy is healthy. And so they, the people that would be attracted to that are. And then they've seen it and had it confirmed. It's going to be hard for them to trust the consensus going forward.

Nate Silver: No, it's also because people are, you know, language and political positioning can be. There can be an element of bluffing. For example, right. Like if I say, oh, I wonder. This is, you know, a slightly spicy example, right. Some people, when they say, I wonder about trans athletes in college athletics or something, but otherwise I'm very supportive of trans rights. And they mean that. So this is just an edge case. Right. Some people say that to test the waters because they're super anti trans. And without more information, then you kind of don't know which is which.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, yeah. The Village is very bad or has a lot of trouble separating good faith from bad faith, for sure. And that's kind of a weakness of our system. So, like you think about the lab leak thing, right? Like the Village rushes to kind of shut that down as a hypothesis. And part of the reason they rushed to shut it down is that a good chunk of the people who are bringing it up were bringing it up in bad faith. These are the same people that doubted literally every other part of COVID And so intellectually, how do you deal with ideas that may or may not be true, but are being weaponized either by foreign actors or weaponized by influencers or grifters or just people arguing in bad faith? That's a really tricky thing that I don't think we've figured out well as a society.

Nate Silver: No, look, I think people in effective altruism have something of the same problem right where they are. It's a small community and they were like way too trusting of SBF in particular. There are a few other examples. But yeah, this is a big problem in the Village is they don't understand that there are people that for political reasons or for personal gain or for clout building or just because they're wrong, but happen to be wrong, but persuasive. Right. They're people who take advantage of your trust and take advantage of the trust that people have in this expert institution and therefore undermine the institution. So you have to like, you have to police from within a little bit more. And if they're a culture of consensus, whereas in the river we criticize and. Or we bet. Yeah, right. Maybe betting's a better mechanism, actually. But in the river, you're supposed to be critical. You're supposed to look for opportunities. You're supposed to look for an opponent whose play of a poker hand doesn't make any sense or a bad betting line that DraftKings post or whatever else. And so I think that's actually a healthy impulse up to a fairly high point.

Ryan Holiday: I'm seeing kind of the opposite, though. So if someone is arguing something from bad faith, like, they're not smart, they're conspiracy theorists, they're. Or whatever, it doesn't necessarily mean that that idea is untrue.

Nate Silver: It's probably true.

Ryan Holiday: And so how. Like, I think that's. During the pandemic, there were, like, when you had a group of people who were just deciding that the virus did not exist and it had no consequences, and they were politically motivated to continue to just resist whatever the people in power were doing, there kind of became this reflexive dismissal of every concern and doubt. So like, like when they were like, hey, I think it's time, like, in Texas, we reopened everything in June of 2020, which was objectively too early. But then when people were trying to reopen schools In June of 21 in California, those people were treated as though they were the same people and they're not. Right?

Nate Silver: Yeah. Maybe we should look at political beliefs as kind of not that important in terms of forming interpersonal relationships. Because, like, for religion, I guess I call myself agnostic or something. Right. But probably, probably a phase. Right. I call myself more aggressively atheist. Right. If someone's like, I'm a practicing Catholic, I wouldn't have been in that phase. Like, oh, fuck you, I'm never talking to you again. You must be crazy, right?

Ryan Holiday: Yeah.

Nate Silver: It's like, okay, you have a belief system and we can still go and get a beer together or enjoy hobbies together or whatever. Right. Have a friendship relationship. People, I think, need to. Need to indulge other people's incorrectness sometimes more often knowing that you have. Have. It's reciprocal that you undoubtedly have beliefs that they find wrong or objectionable or annoying, and they're still your friend. So I think people should think about that.

Ryan Holiday: It's funny, Obama talked about this in his convention speech, that especially for Democrats who by definition, having to create a fairly large consensus, you need a lot of people. So you are a coalition. A minority position can be intellectually pure, but if you're trying to create a broad consensus, you. You can't.

Nate Silver: No, I mean, Democrats have always been the party of misfit toys. Right. People who are intellectuals, people who are struggling. Right. You know, Gay people and immigrants and things like that. It's misfit toys and you have to tell. I mean, one thing I love about New York City, where I live is like, in New York we have to tolerate one of those eccentricities, right? You cannot, because you just will not survive a day without having high practical tolerance. Which is different than the Dutch tolerance. Right? Which is, you know, I have some like Dutch friends, like, you can do what you want, but they're judging you the whole time.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah.

Nate Silver: What? I mean, yeah, yeah.

Ryan Holiday: I saw this TikTok and they were talking about it and they were just like, the rules of New York City is like you didn't see shit. You know, like, I. Not like, not like you're embracing it. It's just like you're fucking minding your own business and you're not somebody jumping the subway turnstile. I don't know, I didn't see. Just like that. That's kind of the. Don't ask, don't tell is obviously a bad phrase given what it was used to do, but it's not a bad policy for the rest of life.

Nate Silver: It might not have been a bad policy for the military in that. In that environment.

Ryan Holiday: Right, sure.

Nate Silver: It's better than persecuting somebody for having gay relations. Right.

Ryan Holiday: In the Navy, I'm saying it doesn't go far. It's just. It was inherently discriminatory. You're right that there was a. Some good intention, but I just generally not asking, not telling. As Tim Walls has been saying, mind your damn business. It's a good strategy for life.

Nate Silver: Another poker thing. Sorry, I'll keep going back to poker. But there is a cost to giving away information that there are reasons why you want ambiguity sometimes and you don't want complete transparency and you are communicating by not saying something. And you can increase optionality with ambiguity sometimes. One reason why I think that that large language models prove surprisingly good is that language is very game like in many respects. So they're good at solving chess or poker. It shouldn't be surprising that they understand how speech works.

Ryan Holiday: Well, shutting the fuck up is a way to increase optionality. William Techunse Sherman had this thing, he's like, never explain why you think what you think because you might change your mind. So your reasons could change. The conclusion might stay the same, but your reasons for it could conclude. But. So the optionality of like, I'm not going to explain my opinion on everything or verbalize every thought as it's coming into existence is a. Is a way to preserve optionality your reputation, and then also your sanity, because you're not locking yourself into stuff.

Nate Silver: Or there might be kind of different equilibria. Right. Either being really reserved or, you know, look, if you're running a newsletter, then, like, a confessional style really works. Like, I'm not posting this newsletter day because I'm, I don't know, on a plane right now, and the wifi's not working. I just want to relax. And that can work, I think. Or being quite selective and quite reserved. And I think one problem that I had kind of working for the Walt Disney Company is I was stuck kind of exactly in the middle ground where I felt constrained. But then the constraints come out in Twitter or in different ways, and it wasn't very ideal.

Ryan Holiday: I was thinking about this the other day. If I was going to inflict a horrible fate on someone, like, I was kind of coming up with a torture. Like, you know, there's that Chinese curse, like, may you live in interesting times. One torture would be you're going to have strong opinions about everything you see, hear, and read. And so you see how people inflict this fate on themselves. I mean, Twitter and social media is designed around prodding you and nudging you to have more opinions, concise opinions, polarizing opinions. And so you not only get yourself into trouble because you can say things that you regret, but I think it also, it changes you as a person because it opens you up. First off, you're now thinking that way, but also you are getting feedback for thinking that way. And it becomes this kind of vicious cycle where you just become hardened and cynical. And also, just like, I interviewed Stephen A. Smith one time, and I was like, you have a thing that you can't turn off. You ever see him, they'll ask him opinions about who would win, this Disney character or that Disney character, and he can, off the top of his head, just create minutes of opinions about things that he's never thought of before. That strikes me as. He's actually funny, but, like, seems kind of genius, actually.

Nate Silver: But, like.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, to do that to someone would be, like, a horrible thing. It feels like.

Nate Silver: I mean, I feel like I have trouble turning it on. Yeah, but you can absorb and read, and you don't have to, like, participate. But, yeah, it is hard. I mean, you know, one thing I like about poker is it kind of because you can't leave a poker tournament without paying a price. It kind of is a commitment device a little bit, you know.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. And how does that help?

Nate Silver: It helps because it's probably Good to have some downtime to reflect. And I enjoy poker. And in principle I'm in games where I'm in principle making money, but usually the opportunity cost would make it negative relative to some other way to spend my time.

Ryan Holiday: But I mean, the commitment device, it just makes you have to stick with the thing you're doing. Is that what you mean?

Nate Silver: Yeah. So say, okay, I'm going to the World series of poker June 5th through June 22nd, and I can't schedule any meetings, go to any conventions, anything else during this time. And it's nice. Probably you're better off going to Japan or something. Although I really like poker. But I think it's very important if you're creative to have downtime. Right. I'm not one of those people who like, I mean, now I'm supposed to say that I have to do it, but the people who are like, oh my gosh, I have a 20 minute Uber ride from downtown SF to SFO airport. I'm going to bang out these six emails. You can't do that. Or at least my metabolism doesn't work that way.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah. Churchill wrote this book called Painting as a Pastime. And he said that every important public person has to have one or two hobbies, and his was painting and bricklaying. And you have to have this thing that's very different than what you do, or it doesn't have to be super different, but it has to be kind of use different muscles, put you in different scenarios. And having that conduit, I think prevents you from going crazy in your work life and using that as your only means of, of expression and your only form of meaning in your life. Yeah.

Nate Silver: Or something for like the local equilibrium. Maximizing that and not the global equilibria is a very nerdy way to put it, I guess.

Ryan Holiday: Yeah, I think that's right. All right, I want to show you some books.

Nate Silver: Next story.
