Unfortunately. You do? Yeah.

0 (2m 25s):
Wow. Like what kind?

1 (2m 27s):
You know, security. Well,

0 (2m 30s):
I'm sorry that you have to do that, but that's the price of fame. And boy, you're you. I mean, man, you're everywhere. You

1 (2m 37s):
Well

0 (2m 37s):
Have d We have the new

1 (2m 38s):
It boy podcast.

0 (2m 39s):
No, no, it's true.

1 (2m 40s):
We, we have different jihadi that want to kill me. The purple hair jihadi, the, the, the woke guys. Well, they want, they

0 (2m 45s):
Kill me. They want to kill me. Justice bad,

1 (2m 48s):
Probably. Oh, they really do. No, you you've been very outspoken on the woke stuff. Big time. Oh, yes.

0 (2m 53s):
I mean, and, And they just, the way within a religion, they hate their own apostates more. I would say they hate me more because I'm supposed to, to like get on the short bus to crazy town with them. And I won't. And yet I'm still a liberal and still like, you know, I mean, we probably could argue all day about Donald Trump And what he is doing, which I'm not down with. But you know, the, it's always the people who are closest to think, oh gosh, you shouldn't have, you're a traitor. Somehow if we don't

1 (3m 29s):
Go along with I was gonna ask is because they thought you were one of them and that I am

0 (3m 32s):
One of them. They're not one of me. I'm okay. It's the liberals of who have,

1 (3m 36s):
So they they've left you, not you left you. Yeah. Well,

0 (3m 38s):
I think that's fair. I feel like there's liberal and woke are two completely different things. It was a theme of my last standup special that I just did a few months ago. And it's basically a, I mean it wasn't the whole special of course, but it was a large part of it devoted to that, to proving that case that, you know, what liberals believe woke is something completely different. It's very often the opposite of it. You know, liberalism is let's live in a colorblind society. That's the goal. Wokes goal is we see race everywhere. Race

1 (4m 9s):
Obsession. Yes.

0 (4m 10s):
Okay. So that's not liberal. You, you change liberal. Is there a two state solution? Woke is river to the sea. Okay. Those are So just don't take my word and say you are that you took this and took it to you got off the F train, you fell asleep and you got off the 20 stops too far. And don't blame me for that drink.

1 (4m 32s):
No, I'm good. Thank you.

0 (4m 33s):
You don't drink No. Or smoke pot? No. And you're married and super Christian. We're gonna get along great.

1 (4m 40s):
No, we're, we're, this is, this is gonna just be perfect,

0 (4m 42s):
But can I just ask you, 'cause I wanna find out a lot about you. 'cause you're, you're obviously a super bright guy, but you do think that I have the right to live completely opposite than you do. You're,

1 (4m 53s):
I I I think you sh you can get as drunk as you'd like

0 (4m 56s):
And you're, you're that kind of an American, right? You're not, of course you're not, you're not f forcing your opinions as

1 (5m 2s):
I, I'm, I'm not here to say you can't. What do you talking about

0 (5m 4s):
It? No. Okay. So you think pot should be illegal? That's

1 (5m 6s):
A, that's a complicated, I I have a very unpopular view on pot. You know, let, let, let Can I tell you my case on pot? Please do. It's not the depression that it might be causing or the fact that it might be hurting kids' brains. It's, it's the smell. It's the stench that drives me crazy. Yeah.

0 (5m 23s):
It's not hurting their brains. I mean, kids shouldn't do it. Of course, kids shouldn't. Okay. It, it definitely hurt. Didn't hurt my brain.

1 (5m 28s):
But let me ask, do you think that more, more teenagers are doing pot today? Or that before legalization or after legalization? No, you know, what do you think usage rates are going up or down? I don't know the answer.

0 (5m 39s):
Oh. Oh, you'll be fascinated by this. Because, you know, I'm not married, so I go out. So sometimes I'm out with like, people who are a great deal younger than me. I don't know how they get in my group, but they do. And so I've been to sometimes parties, like the Hollywood parties, and this is probably not most of America exactly this way, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's that different. And first of all, in this town, it's all run by like the NPO babies, the NPO babies, the trust fund kids is all these little funny 2-year-old brands.

1 (6m 9s):
The JB Pritzker types.

0 (6m 12s):
Well, I'm kidding. I'm No, no, I'm sure I, I I know who you mean. The governor of Illinois. Yeah.

1 (6m 16s):
He inherited the Hyatt. Oh, sure. You know,

0 (6m 19s):
NPO baby I, come on. We we invented NPO baby out here on, but yes, it's everywhere now. Even on the Lakers.

1 (6m 26s):
Hey, that, that's, that's real privilege there. You know, you got some privilege if you can get,

0 (6m 30s):
Well, okay. I don't want, I want LeBron mad at me like he is at my friend Stephen. A but I mean, that is, I, you know, but the point is that when you go out to these, I've been to these parties where like, it's a bunch of 22-year-old kids and none of them are smoking pot. Why? They're on real drugs pot. So like my generation, it was like I couldn't fine pot at one of these parties. I was the one they were asking me for it. The few kids or whatever, they're all, they take this,

1 (7m 2s):
This, they've got like psychedelics or mushrooms, LSB, okay.

0 (7m 6s):
Oh, ketamine, whatever.

1 (7m 7s):
Oh, ketamine. That, that has some medicinal property, but not at a party.

0 (7m 11s):
They're all, it's all ingested before they even leave the house. So that's where the good news parents, your kids aren't on pot.

1 (7m 20s):
Yeah, but they're, they're on way

0 (7m 22s):
Worse. I

1 (7m 23s):
Think they're on a big, big trip. So, but do you think that since we've legalized less teenagers are doing like 13, 14, 15 year olds? Because that was always the argument, right? If we legalize it, less kids would do it.

0 (7m 33s):
I don't know what 14 year olds are doing.

1 (7m 35s):
No, I don't know the answer. I just,

0 (7m 37s):
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

1 (7m 39s):
But we, we can agree that kids shouldn't, that's how we

0 (7m 42s):
Oh, totally. Yeah. But we also should be able to agree that we shouldn't force adults to organize their lives around what kids might get into.

1 (7m 51s):
That's, that's a good argument. I mean, do you think that it's,

0 (7m 54s):
I mean, you're not against porn, are you?

1 (7m 55s):
Well, I actually once struggled with porn. Thankfully. I'm free of that. But I mean,

0 (7m 59s):
How can you struggle with it? I

1 (8m 1s):
Mean, meaning

0 (8m 2s):
It so

1 (8m 2s):
Easy. Well, you could, you could grow addicted to it. I mean, it can, I know.

0 (8m 7s):
I was kidding.

1 (8m 7s):
No, but it was, I mean, yeah, I don't have that, that issue anymore, thankfully. But I would, I would ask the question though, like, do you think since the legalization of marijuana in LA it's made it a better or worse place to live? Or just it hasn't changed at all?

0 (8m 22s):
It certainly hasn't changed my life. Okay. I grew it right outside here.

1 (8m 27s):
Do you think this, do you think the quality of life has gone up or down?

0 (8m 30s):
Well, I, I don't know, but that's not really the relevant question. Is it e even if there is a deleterious effect, there is too many things we do. And we would not use that as a reason to prescribe our basic freedoms. Should

1 (8m 43s):
People, I mean, be able to do drugs? Should

0 (8m 46s):
People

1 (8m 46s):
Outside like on the street or

0 (8m 48s):
No, definitely not on the street. Okay. So,

1 (8m 51s):
So, so there are some limits. Of

0 (8m 52s):
Course there are limits, yes. And maybe of certain drugs or certain drugs should be by prescription as we do with, with pharmaceutical drugs, you know, but based, but certainly pot is more, is more benign than alcohol. I mean, I could give you the stats on that. We all know that. I, I is is it health food? No. I, I, I'm not crazy. Like some of my hippie friends are c complain trying to portray it as something that's actually good for your lungs. But I, I don't think it's, well, it's a trade off. When you're an adult, you have the right to make trade-offs. Trade-offs is the, is the, is the essence of life.

0 (9m 33s):
I'm gonna have this piece of cake tonight and be a little fatter tomorrow, or I'm not gonna do that and feel better tomorrow. And we all make those choices on a daily basis with everything. Yes. Have I probably cut off some years of my life, maybe with pot? Who knows. I may have increased them because it helped me, it made me certainly made me richer. It made me better at my job, better at writing better. A lot of things I like to do. So, you know, I might be living in a two bedroom apartment in Van Nuys if it wasn't for pot, and I'd probably gonna live longer year.

1 (10m 7s):
Or who knows how successful you could have been without it.

0 (10m 10s):
That's true too. That is true too.

1 (10m 12s):
Do you, do you think there's any merit to the argument that the pot is, has more THC and is more intense than it was 30, 40 years ago? It's so hard. I, I don't know. I, I hear these things and Oh, I

0 (10m 22s):
Hear those things too. And I'm, I'm sure that's true because once it became as commercialized as it has, of course you're going, you're gonna try to maximize the potency of it just because the customer comes back just like a restaurant is not interested in your health. They're interested in making the food as

1 (10m 38s):
Selling more product delicious

0 (10m 40s):
As they can and addictive. Yeah. You come back to that restaurant. So, but it's so hard for me to tell you because I've been smoking for 50 years and I'm different. Who knows what I was thinking. I mean, I remember when I first smoked, we would just sit in the car and laugh at nothing for an hour. That doesn't happen anymore. So I'm, my guess is the pot is stronger, but my resistance is weaker.

1 (11m 5s):
Okay.

0 (11m 6s):
Anyway, it's, you know, I, I'm, people think I'm some sort of giant pothead. I've always been very circumspect about my pot smoking. I mean, I don't smoke every day. The most I smoke is right here once a week. I, I like to be in party mode when I'm with someone. I'm getting to know. I I, I, this is one of the joys of my life. And you know, I understand that it doesn't connect with some people or makes some people paranoid or something. But other people it's just, I mean, you know, some people like a scotch and some people like la la la and some people like complete sobriety. If, if that's your, if that's your thing, that's fine.

0 (11m 46s):
But to me, the most interesting place I can ever travel is inside my own mind. And drugs do help you get there.

1 (11m 55s):
Is there, do you think all, all hard drugs should be illegal? Like heroin

0 (11m 60s):
Illegal? No. I mean, well, heroin, is there any uses for it? I mean

1 (12m 5s):
Like for what San Francisco did? They, they pseudo legalized it, right? I mean, they said, Hey, we're gonna have make it easier for you to do heroin.

0 (12m 10s):
No, we shouldn't make it easier. That's crazy.

1 (12m 12s):
Where they had drug injection sites, basically. Right. That,

0 (12m 15s):
That's

1 (12m 15s):
So No, I know, but that's, that was a public policy position of Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco.

0 (12m 19s):
That's the low lying fruit for you right

1 (12m 22s):
There. No, that's, it's a

0 (12m 24s):
Question. It's no, but but isn't it, I

1 (12m 25s):
Want create

0 (12m 26s):
It's the low lying fruit who it's like, no, sure. It's a

1 (12m 29s):
Right,

0 (12m 31s):
It's

1 (12m 31s):
A boundary. I wanna create a boundary. And

0 (12m 33s):
You're right. You know, I mean, again, I'm, I'm for picking that fruit too. It's silly to help drug addicts be drug addicts and keep them on the street. It's stupid to keep homeless on the street.

1 (12m 43s):
Oh, I totally

0 (12m 44s):
Agree with. That's another, another way liberals are different. In the woke, the liberal thing for forever was for compassion's sake, get them off the street. That's not the woke version. Their version is they're an endangered species. Don't touch them in their natural habitat, living under a bridge.

1 (13m 0s):
Let 'em defecate. Let 'em do whatever they want. It's

0 (13m 2s):
Their thing. And you know, I mean, there should be nothing more basic than a government claiming the streets. The streets are for the citizens then. It's not to live in I agree. Build a barracks. I mean, why are these things, maybe you can answer that. Why are these kind of things so difficult that you think such common sense? Build a fucking barracks. I know homeless people say they don't wanna live there. You don't have a choice. Oh, we'll get robbed there. Higher security. It's pennies on the dollar. Why? Why is it so difficult? I feel like I, with no real knowledge of this field could do it could just, if I had people who would carry out my, I would say, okay, get me specs. I want to see what, where a place we could build it.

0 (13m 44s):
I wanna see what the barracks looks like. I wanna see who works there is, is it really? And the toilets, whatever. And somebody must be able to Mitt Romney, somebody who did the Olympics. Somebody who could come in and

1 (13m 57s):
Just, we know how to clean up the streets. I mean, Gavin Newsom cleaned up the streets of San Francisco and Gigi Ping showed up. I mean, it's just an act of the will. They, they don't want to do it. Right.

0 (14m 4s):
Like when they get the who off the street. When, when the mayor's like doing one cleanup

1 (14m 8s):
Or like when the MLB All Star game goes to Seattle, all of a sudden it's America's cleanest city.

0 (14m 13s):
Right. So you're saying if we can do it that one day, well,

1 (14m 17s):
I'm saying it's an act of the will. It's all that it is. And it look left woke, I won't even say left thing, woke philosophy is they believe, they don't really believe in private property. And at its core, why shouldn't someone be able to defecate on the side of the street? Who are you to judge?

0 (14m 32s):
Well, that's not woke. Yes. Maybe

1 (14m 34s):
I'm saying woke not even liberal. Right. I'm making that distinction. Right. Good. Which I think is a fair distinction. That's another

0 (14m 38s):
Reason. Another one we can add to the list of woke is not liberal, is

1 (14m 43s):
No, I, and I think left versus liberal or woke versus liberal is an important distinction. Right. I will say what makes you different is few liberals stand up to the woke and few, that that is very, that few liberals are correct. Willing to stand up to woke.

0 (14m 55s):
Absolutely. And few conservatives stand up to Trump.

1 (14m 58s):
Fair enough. I mean, you can stand up or disagree, but I guess you could say the question Well, is Trump woke? Is an ideology, is Trump an ideology? I mean, he's a person. Maga is in ideology, but I mean, we can I disagree with Trump on a lot of stuff. Yeah. I mean, I don't think we should go to war with a run. I think that'd be a big mistake.

0 (15m 17s):
Also, when you get to, we're gonna send homegrown American citizens to foreign prisons.

1 (15m 24s):
Oh, so you, the thing he said, you mean

0 (15m 26s):
Homegrown to, to bhel Americans to No,

1 (15m 29s):
If he were to do that, I wouldn't support it.

0 (15m 31s):
Great.

1 (15m 32s):
But I don't, I think that is a one-liner that he gave to Buke. I think that is, you met the man.

0 (15m 38s):
Yes. I I

1 (15m 39s):
Do you think he actually believes that? Like he would do that? I

0 (15m 42s):
It's worse if he does or would. It's still horrible that an American president would say that. Look me in the eye and tell me if Obama had said that, what your reaction would be.

1 (15m 53s):
Wouldn't wouldn't like it.

0 (15m 55s):
Wouldn't like it. I think it would be a little more vitriolic than that.

1 (15m 58s):
I I, we, we would be, we'd be upset

0 (16m 0s):
Apoplectic. Okay. I'm just, I'm finding out how honest you are, Charlie. And so far you're, I think you're doing good and I hope I'm doing good with you. But when, because if we don't have the honesty, we can't really, you know,

1 (16m 13s):
Look. But to be, to also, to be fair to the whole, you know, topic in general, the outrage around deportations, as we've seen, you know, this, these last couple of, you know, last couple of weeks is like the American people voted for it. It's perfectly legal. Well,

0 (16m 30s):
They didn't vote for,

1 (16m 31s):
They did vote for mass deportations

0 (16m 33s):
People without any, I mean the, the

1 (16m 35s):
So you mean that Maryland case is what you're talking about? Right?

0 (16m 38s):
The guy who they're trying, who they said

1 (16m 40s):
The MS 13 member.

0 (16m 41s):
Well, there's no evidence that he's, they don't, they did not present evidence. I mean, I don't really want to get into the weeds on this one 'cause I gotta do it on my show Friday. But, and, but the Supreme Court, I guess we have to get into the weeds there. You know, there

1 (17m 2s):
Is, there's there's, it's even new evidence in the last couple of hours that I don't, you, you, you, you, you lead the conversation. You tell me how deep you want to go on.

0 (17m 12s):
None. Okay. I mean, but I hope that if it, if it comes to light, let put, let me button it up this way. I hope that if it does come to light, that there really is no evidence that this guy was a gang member, that he got swept up. Which is very understandable that when you do a sweep, when you're doing big things, yes, there's nothing is gonna go perfect. But if it does come to light, I would hope that some Republicans have the spine to say, yeah, that's not right. This guy should not be there. I mean, the Bill of Rights, it's pretty clear that you can't just disappear people without any sort of trial.

0 (17m 56s):
Well,

1 (17m 57s):
But sorry to interrupt. And,

0 (17m 58s):
And, and, and deportation isn't, is not the same thing as sending someone to a prison,

1 (18m 4s):
But you are allowed to deport under the Alien Enemies Act. Correct. Wow. Someone, someone who is part of a, a recognized terrorist organization. Well, which MS 13 is Okay. Pretty close to a terrorist organization. Yeah.

0 (18m 17s):
Okay. I mean, you know, you're, you're bending all these words

1 (18m 20s):
And he's not an American citizen. We gotta acknowledge that. Correct. No,

0 (18m 23s):
Absolutely

1 (18m 23s):
Not. So that's important.

0 (18m 24s):
But he wasn't here illegally either. And he was illegally

1 (18m 27s):
Yeah. The Maryland man, we, I, as long as we're not talking about two different cases,

0 (18m 31s):
We're talking about Garcia. Garcia.

1 (18m 32s):
Yes. He was an illegal immigrant to the country.

0 (18m 36s):
I thought he was waiting for asylum case

1 (18m 38s):
That you can be illegal waiting for asylum. I

0 (18m 40s):
See. So we Okay. So they could deport him. That's right. Yes. But we never did it. But to a prison,

1 (18m 45s):
It's an edge case. I acknowledge it's on the edge.

0 (18m 48s):
Okay,

1 (18m 48s):
Good. No, but the edge is, so there's three ways you can deport people. It could be the, an Alien Enemies Act of 1798. It can be

0 (18m 57s):
Used only three times.

1 (18m 58s):
That's fine. But hey, look,

0 (18m 59s):
And you

1 (18m 60s):
Quote the First Amendment all the time. That's from 1787. Right. So old things are, are important. I'm just saying just because it's old. But

0 (19m 8s):
That's been used, that's been used more than three times.

1 (19m 10s):
Fair enough. But just 'cause things are old doesn't mean, and I'm not saying you're using that talking point, but some people are trying to invalidate it just 'cause it's old. Well, it's also expedited release they're

0 (19m 20s):
Trying to invalidate because it doesn't really apply to this that it's stretching.

1 (19m 23s):
I mean, how is MS 13 not a terrorist organization? I mean

0 (19m 27s):
Yeah, you can, yeah. You can make that

1 (19m 29s):
Or trend deua. I mean, well, I mean, organized funding.

0 (19m 32s):
Well, because, because terrorism really is a political movement. It's, it's, it's to, it's to, it means to terrorizing the civilian population to achieve a political goal. These guys just want to grab your locket, you know, there this is, it's a little more than that. And Oh, yeah. A lot more than that. Look, I've said that all this stuff I don't like about Trump. I did it in my piece the other week when I was talking about the meeting at the White House that no, he was tweeting about me. I've never liked anything. No. Check the tape. There are things I like. And one thing I liked was that the police are, have their morale back maybe now.

0 (20m 13s):
And you know, when you live in a city, it's not a good thing when the police lose their morale because they feel like they've been painted with a broad brush, which they were after 2020, you know, and they're like, okay. You know, and I've been very critical of the cops when I think they did bad things. But do I think that's as it's a racist, you know, attack squad, it's not, there's issues, there's always issues in everything in big organizations. And you know, when, when you insult the cops, they have a way of kind of brooding about it. And it's just not a good place to be in when you're, when you're a city dweller.

0 (20m 54s):
And so, you know, I don't want to be killed by a gang member because they do random killings, you know, just to as gang initiation so they can get the fucking teardrop under their eye. Okay. I I don't wanna be someone's teardrop tattoo, you know, rando out to dinner. So I get it. You know, I'm, I mean, these, these are the things that lost the Democrats, the election

1 (21m 17s):
100%. You know,

0 (21m 19s):
You gotta take care of this shit. I was just,

1 (21m 20s):
And and there's real Americans that die. I mean, Rachel Moore and Lake and Riley. There's real, I I mean, Jocelyn,

0 (21m 27s):
Well, probably not at greater rates than are killed by regular Americans.

1 (21m 31s):
That's debated. But let's just put that aside. They shouldn't be here. And so none of those murders should happen. Right, right. And so anyway, back to the core question. Does the president have the ability to remove illegals that have come here under an enemy gang? Of course he does. Yeah. I mean, he has, he has the power given to him by that law.

So you're 31, what's your background? I, I, I'm gonna have to lack Larry King. This, you know what, like Larry King used to just famously and I love Larry. I did a show a billion times.

1 (26m 20s):
He was a legend. Yeah. I've never met him.

0 (26m 23s):
And his thing was like, I don't prepare. I'm, I'm like the regular guy who just wants to know he's curious about this person. So I don't know. So I asked the questions that this person would ask you. Charlie Kirk, you're 31 years old, you're Jewish, right? No. Yeah.

1 (26m 38s):
That's Muslim. Actually, no.

0 (26m 42s):
You're married. Yes. Yes sir. How long have you been

1 (26m 43s):
Married? It will be four years in May.

0 (26m 46s):
Wow. And kids,

1 (26m 48s):
Two kids. Yeah. Two

0 (26m 49s):
Kids already.

1 (26m 50s):
Yeah. Well, we got to work

0 (26m 53s):
Now, Charlie. It shouldn't be work. That's all I'm gonna say metaphor.

1 (26m 57s):
I'm kidding. I know. It's an enjoyable work. It's

0 (27m 0s):
Okay.

1 (27m 1s):
We got to the fun, I should say.

0 (27m 2s):
And, and and you're gonna have more

1 (27m 6s):
God willing. Yeah.

0 (27m 7s):
God willing. Right, right. And you know, we don't see eye to eye on the religion thing.

1 (27m 11s):
You know, someone told me that

0 (27m 13s):
I got, I gotta tell you, you should see my movie Religion.

1 (27m 16s):
I actually saw it. Oh, really? And to your credit, ah, thank you. What you did on Islam was awesome.

0 (27m 26s):
The other one's not so much

1 (27m 28s):
Buddy. Secondly, So if you just isolate the Islamic part, but it

0 (27m 31s):
Was funny,

1 (27m 32s):
Secondly, Jesus, to your credit, you treated woke like a religion. Yes. And you criticize them with the same intensity and ity You did. And that does, you deserve a lot of credit for that. Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. It No, I mean that because you looked at it as this has right catechism, it has religious type under recurrence. Totally. It has almost a metaphysical presence to itself. And so you're, you're an equal opportunity.

0 (27m 55s):
Well, I critic, I mean, yeah. And it's funny because the director of religious, Larry, Charles and I had dinner about a year ago, and I suggested, and of course it went nowhere 'cause we're both too old to like really act on it. But I said, people keep asking me, and I'm sure him also to do religious too, but they, when they say it, they think we're gonna, oh, now we're gonna go to India, make fun of the Hindus. I'm like, I'm not doing that. Okay. I'm not going to India. And the Hindus aren't that funny. Okay. We did it, it was a, the movie did great. And we, we love that it stands the test of time. And people keep, always keep coming up to me and seeing it. Movies are amazing that way. But I said, somebody gave me a great idea. Why don't we do religious two?

0 (28m 37s):
But the religion is wokeness. Oh. And then that's what I was suggested. And I said, yeah, but then you're gonna have to do the right side of it too, because that's also a religion. Christian nationalism, I mean, come on, your boys. Some of the people I think you're fond of, they mix religion and politics in a way that I think is not according to the Constitution. But I have to tell you, I'll give you a lot of credit. I saw a video of yours where you were talking about how Christy, the original documents were, which is, you know, I mean, my view is that the founding fathers, we know a number of them were deists.

0 (29m 25s):
Mostly that was their religion. But you did, and you, boy, you have your facts down. I mean, you can spiel when you get on a subject like this,

1 (29m 33s):
I got the stick down.

0 (29m 34s):
You'd really do. And I trust you. You know, I'm going by what you, but you know that they were a little christer than I thought, you know? And I'm always happy to learn new information. And if it doesn't satisfy people that I don't stay exactly where I am, it satisfies the people who are actually my fans who always want me to do that. To be like, oh, if I take in new information, I mean, that's why, you know, the the far left hates me because I went to the White House and said, well, privately trump's different,

1 (30m 2s):
I didn't, and and good for you for saying that.

0 (30m 4s):
Yeah. And I, I didn't give an inch on anything. I believe I confronted him on things that I think, you know, he ne prob maybe never hears from anybody else, but that's not good enough for them because, you know, they had to. But no, if you take new information, just tell me. And so I do think after listening to your spiel that yes, they were a little more into Jesus than I thought. I mean, I know Jefferson wrote that Bible and took all, he heavily

1 (30m 32s):
Edited it,

0 (30m 32s):
Took all the miracles out. He took all the, the religiosity out of it and just made him a, a,

1 (30m 38s):
A moral

0 (30m 38s):
Teacher, a moral philosopher. Now you have to admit, that's not exactly the act of a Christy person.

1 (30m 45s):
No. But at least he acknowledged that there was something profound there. Gotta give him credit for that.

0 (30m 49s):
I could even acknowledge that. Okay.

1 (30m 50s):
That's good. No, I, I'm glad to hear you say that.

0 (30m 52s):
Well, as a Jesus, as a philosopher was a true revolutionary. I mean, when he said the meek shall inherit the earth, I think the response was

1 (30m 59s):
Blessed. It are the peacemakers, right?

0 (31m 1s):
Yeah. But the idea that it gets good in the next life was fairly, I think, revolutionary. And the fact that, you know, if you're a good person in this life, there's a much greater, this is just the pregame. You want the after party don't say, and the after party is just gonna be fucking awesome. You're up there with me and my dad, God. And it's just, you know, what

1 (31m 28s):
Do you think cre would create a better society or better action people that think that there isn't, there is an afterlife based on how you act, or people that think there isn't one? That's

0 (31m 37s):
A great question, because it certainly can turn people either way. It can make you fly planes into a building. I'm not speaking of any specific examples.

1 (31m 45s):
I, I can't think of anything. I

0 (31m 46s):
Can't either. But it can make you do that. You'll admit that.

1 (31m 50s):
Sure. Okay. It could also make you do like blow up Oklahoma City too.

0 (31m 54s):
Yes. And it can also, I fully acknowledge and it all, and I fully acknowledge that it also keeps millions of people in line like Mark Wahlberg. I'm guessing without Catholicism, he just looks like a guy who would be in a lot more trouble. But I think it just has, has made his life, you know, much more under control. So, so there's one, mark Wahlberg I think really benefits from Catholicism. And, but I think there's lots of people like that. They just, like, they truly are worried that if they do something out of line, illegal or immoral, that the devil will in short order after they die, be poking them in the ass with a pitchfork.

0 (32m 38s):
And so they don't do that. And I gotta give it up. That's a, you know, that is a positive.

1 (32m 43s):
Do you, do you, are you at all worried that when a nation becomes too secular, it might not know what it believes? There's no cultural cohesion. There's no glue that keeps it together. Yeah,

0 (32m 54s):
But this isn't that a nation, this says it isn't secular. This is a bunch of fucking religious reeks.

1 (32m 58s):
It's increasingly secular though.

0 (32m 59s):
Well, thank you. It's,

1 (33m 1s):
I'm trying. No, but se I,

0 (33m 3s):
I

1 (33m 3s):
Appreciate it. You are quite the evangelist for I the cause of no afterlife and no creator.

0 (33m 7s):
I mean, it, it, you know what, it creeps up a little. But people, people always are going to want it. They want, they, people always are gonna want to believe a story. It's much better than the truth, which is that things are random. We don't know the big questions. We don't know how we got here. We don't know why we're here. We don't know how the universe started. We're alone in the universe. You know, is there a god? What is the nature of God? Which one is the right God? We just don't, nobody knows. I mean, that's why they call it faith.

1 (33m 37s):
Do you hope you're wrong? That's, that's the most important question.

0 (33m 41s):
That's a great question. Well, how

1 (33m 47s):
Do you hope there's a heaven?

0 (33m 51s):
I hope they figure out how I can live forever. I like it here with you, Charlie, drinking this and smoking pot and Fiji. I'm having a great time. I really can't imagine it better. I mean, I can't. And that maybe it is. I'm sure it is. I'm sure you know, people have, but,

1 (34m 10s):
But something in you probably hopes that, I don't know. Yes, Hitler gets ultimate judgment or the most evil things, right? Something in you wants to see your loved ones. And

0 (34m 20s):
I don't think about

1 (34m 22s):
Hitler. No. There's gotta be a desire somewhere. A lot

0 (34m 24s):
Of people just think about Hitler. A I know, but I'm just saying Hitler comes up a lot. He just, he

1 (34m 31s):
Really fair enough. Let's that there's a, a desire that there's some something beyond this. Well, that is just, okay.

0 (34m 43s):
Yes, I do. But I mean, it's very hard to find that justice on earth. Ask an AIDS baby. No,

1 (34m 48s):
Don't Bill. That's why when you say, Hey, I'm happy here. There's a lot of suffering on Earth too. And that's the it is.

0 (34m 53s):
And some, and some of

1 (34m 53s):
That's the Christian argument, right? And

0 (34m 55s):
Some of it is, is, you know, we, we obviously can see it comes from no bad deed done, you know, child, children with cancer. Of

1 (35m 3s):
Course it's, and it's, it's,

0 (35m 4s):
And then they say, well that's, you know, God works in mysterious ways, which is sort of a get outta jail card. It's the hardest for any kind of non-thinking.

1 (35m 12s):
Admittedly, it's the hardest. We as Christians have to explain unjust suffering. Atheists have to explain everything else. How

0 (35m 18s):
Do you

1 (35m 19s):
Explain it? We don't, it's hard. It's a mystery. We can say God work his mysterious ways. We can say original sin. However, we don't have to explain creation or the miracle of life or love or justice or No, we, we,

0 (35m 31s):
We don't have to explain it either because it's not explainable, because we don't know. We say we don't know that's honest. You say no, somebody told a story a long time ago and we're gonna stick with that. That to me, I'm not trying to be insulting.

1 (35m 49s):
No, you can't offend me. Trust me. I mean that. So you could be as crude or as blunt. Okay, I

0 (35m 53s):
Just

1 (35m 54s):
Mean that. It's not

0 (35m 55s):
I, but I find that intellectually embarrassing.

1 (35m 57s):
That's fine.

Freedom from Religion Foundation (37m 31s):
Club Random is brought to you by the Freedom From Religion Foundation. You ever notice how more and more people are stepping away from organized religion? Not my last guess, but in general, it's like we all collectively realize, wait, I don't actually have to go to synagogue on Friday, or church on Sundays and boom, sleeping in one. But here's the thing, not everyone's cool with this shift. Christian nationalism is on the rise, and they're working overtime to shove their beliefs into our laws, our schools, and even our personal lives. It's like, Hey, I respect your right to believe whatever you want. Just don't make me live by it. That's where the freedom from Religion Foundation comes in. They fight to keep church and state separate like our founders actually intended. So whether you've always been secular or have left religion behind, believe in keeping faith out of our government.

0 (40m 3s):
Well, no,

1 (40m 4s):
It's an important question. Meaning like certainly when they were documenting King David, like, was King David a real figure? There

0 (40m 9s):
There are, there are are shards of it that are okay, I'm

1 (40m 12s):
Sure. So Jesus was a real person.

0 (40m 14s):
Well, that we don't know. That is not a definitive, okay. So it really is not

1 (40m 18s):
Like, take Paul, we both agree Paul was legit and a real person. Paul was a Jew, persecuted Jews, and then had his, you know, rode to Damascus moment. Why would he do that? Except for the fact that he's crazy or like delusional. But what incentive would Paul have to do that rich ruling class gave up everything.

0 (40m 40s):
You, you know, you're, you're saying to me, are there, is there never a case of human delusion or mass delusion or people can, why

1 (40m 49s):
They're suicide cults? Of course there are no, I I acknowledge that

0 (40m 52s):
The capacity, the human capacity to believe what's not true, to believe what you wanna believe is infinite. I mean, you are literally the person I'm talking about at the very beginning of the movie religious, because the very first scene I'm sitting in the car and I'm saying the, the movie is not a spiritual quest. I mean, that's what we told them. So they'd sign the release. The movie is me saying, I don't know how it could be that so many intelligent people can wall off a part of their mind and believe in something that part of their mind must know is not true. That's the question I'm going for in religious and, and like, you're obviously a super smart guy.

0 (41m 33s):
Well, and

1 (41m 33s):
Respectfully, I you go ahead. Sure.

0 (41m 35s):
And I'm, again, I don't want to insult you on that and I appreciate

1 (41m 38s):
You saying that. No, I mean, have you seen me go to college campuses? There's nothing that can fake,

0 (41m 42s):
But you understand my,

1 (41m 43s):
I

0 (41m 43s):
My question,

1 (41m 44s):
Right? Interestingly, ironically, I have the same struggle. I don't know how somebody as intelligent as you, and I'm not, I'm not trying to offend you.

0 (41m 51s):
You cannot believe an

1 (41m 52s):
Emerge birth. No hold time out. Hold on. All of that takes faith. I acknowledge. But that all of the fine tuning of our universe, if any of those fine tunings were off a famous, a famous scientist, some

0 (42m 5s):
Of them are off.

1 (42m 6s):
A famous scientist said to believe that the universe and the earth and its current composition was an act of randomness, would believe that a hurricane would go through a junkyard and assemble a 7 37 flight. Ready Boeing,

0 (42m 18s):
He's wrong.

1 (42m 19s):
Okay, that's fine. But there are so many fine tuning aspects to our existence that I think defy the idea that this is all randomness and all chance. Now, you

0 (42m 31s):
Know, that's not logical. You, you're saying, because I don't know the answer. I'm going to assume the answer must be that a divine intervention did it. That's not really a scientific way of looking

1 (42m 43s):
At it. Well, the cosmo, so the cosmo, the teleological view, not the cosmological view is that all of these fine tunings when layered up one after the other, it defies I think reason to think that this is just the roll of the dice. That when you see a baby come into the world, when you see how we naturally heal, when you even consciousness itself, I think is a pretty miraculous thing to think that's all just a bunch of, but happy accidents. But it, I mean, I think it's more rational to think that that's a byproduct of design.

0 (43m 16s):
You're saying some prime mover made it so these things. Correct. Made it so these things happen. I would say if a prime mover could do that, why don't skip all the suffering and why don't you just get us to where we're the perfect thing why you need things? I don't know. But okay, the perfect being right away, we're, we're somehow on this journey to being, you know, completely immortal and healthy, I guess, and, and, and, and completely moral and don't fuck each other up and don't have sex with children and all the bad things we do. All the

1 (43m 52s):
Evil of

0 (43m 53s):
Our world, right? Yeah. All the evil and the holocaust. And why go through all that? If you are a prime mover? I assume that means you can do anything and just get us right to the end and then we can just, what, why just a bunch of us walking around being perfect. I mean, why is that interesting to a God? You know? The whole thing just don't make sense.

1 (44m 13s):
I get So that's a, that's a separate question though of whether or not there is something behind our existence. I mean, so we believe that the universe started with a big bang. Do you agree with that?

0 (44m 23s):
Yeah, but that's not the beginning of things. That's just the beginning of what the known universe is. The big question is what was before that.

1 (44m 31s):
And we believe it's a, a, a being, right? A God. That's, that's always, that's a

0 (44m 35s):
Constant. And it could, and look, I mean, you know, the, the, the misnomer about atheism is that we say, oh, there's no God no. We just, we just say we don't know. As Richard Dawkins always says, there's theism, which is belief in god's, And they used to believe in many, and then it got to one. And we just believe in one less. So there's just, just not how,

1 (44m 58s):
How would you differentiate that from agnosticism? There

0 (45m 1s):
Isn't. Okay. That's, that's another thing that's bullshit. No,

1 (45m 3s):
I I I don't, I'm just asking.

0 (45m 4s):
I'm just

1 (45m 5s):
Faith

0 (45m 5s):
Question. No, I think a lot of atheists think that a lot of people on my team with this, they have that view that, you know, don't split hairs with the atheist and the agnostics. It's like it's, we're on some part of, I don't know when I really, and I'll never know. So I really don't think about it a lot. I don't get up for church. I try to be a good person because I just think intrinsically it's, it's good for society. It's good for me to be a good person as much as I can. And I don't need the threat of the pitchfork in the ass to do it.

1 (45m 39s):
Can I, can I ask a, a question? So how, how, how, but you even acknowledge though that some people act better if they feel as if they'll be judged eternal. Totally. Okay. No, that's, that's a big, that's a big admission, but Oh yes. How, how do you think society best determines what is good?

0 (45m 58s):
That's a great question. I mean, isn't that what government is always wrestling with? What makes society good

1 (46m 5s):
Do you think even as an atheist, the 10 Commandments, the right side of the 10 Commandments is a good place to start the right side. Well, 'cause the left side, I think you would have a big problem, right?

0 (46m 13s):
I have a problem with, with eight of the 10, because only two of them are laws.

1 (46m 18s):
You got a problem with eight of the 10,

0 (46m 19s):
Two of them are laws only two. What do you mean don't kill

1 (46m 23s):
And don't steal. Okay.

0 (46m 24s):
And don't steal. Sure. Like, I mean this idea that God is this, but

1 (46m 29s):
You're good with those two obviously.

0 (46m 30s):
Like the first four are just jealous God shit. It's just like, you know what God,

1 (46m 35s):
Like no honoring your parents is not jealous. God's stuff like,

0 (46m 38s):
God's like a pimp who's in the next room and he is who you on the phone with there, girl. You know? I mean,

1 (46m 45s):
But

0 (46m 45s):
I mean, I guess I'm testing that.

1 (46m 47s):
Hold on. But no, it's, again, I'm, I'm not offendable on this, but I think you could have, I know you made fun of it in religious, but there's something beautiful about not working for a day.

0 (46m 56s):
Oh,

1 (46m 57s):
Day. No, I mean like honoring the Sabbath. Oh,

0 (46m 59s):
I a week is even better. But like the sa well, the Sabbath, no, I mean the Sabbath

1 (47m 4s):
Is, but slowing down and saying that we're not gonna toil for a day. I know,

0 (47m 8s):
But I, but do you need, why would you need a religion to get to that? Why would you need a religion to, Hey, let's not kill each other and take a day off. Like I, I, again, I don't need a threat or a Garrett for that. It just, it's just so intrinsic. It's, it sort of reminds me of the beginning of the Declaration of Independence. Yeah.

1 (47m 28s):
If it's intrinsic, then why is it that a lot of countries that don't have Christianity struggle to come to these realizations that, for example, you know, communist China, I'll again, no Hitler analogies right under Mao, which was, which was resolutely atheist, right?

0 (47m 45s):
Resolutely, yeah. I mean, well, no, I did a monologue in religious.

1 (47m 49s):
They might have Confucianism underlying it.

0 (47m 51s):
I, I did a monologue in religious about that very subject, which is the people who say, oh, bill, these atheistic societies, like, like North Korea and no, those kind of societies, they just replaced the leader of the country for a God. They are not atheistic. When you look at what the Korean, the North Korean people believe about Kim Jong-un. It's,

1 (48m 16s):
It's, it's a deification of,

0 (48m 17s):
It's a de I

1 (48m 18s):
Mean, I completely

0 (48m 19s):
Agree the same shit that he, when he was born winter turned to spring, he once he, he'll

1 (48m 24s):
Be a mortal in the heaven. The

0 (48m 25s):
First time he played golf, he got 11 holes in one. He invented the hamburger. I'm not making

1 (48m 30s):
That's more improbable than a virgin birth. It

0 (48m 32s):
Is, it really is.

1 (48m 34s):
So we, we agree.

0 (48m 34s):
I'm not making this up, but they believe that. So don't tell me North Korea is atheistic. They're not atheistic,

1 (48m 40s):
But, but they, there is a there in, in, in China at least. And of course in the Soviet Union, there was a anti-Christian movement. Very hard,

0 (48m 50s):
Very

1 (48m 51s):
Hardcore. Okay, so I guess like what code, and I'm not saying this sarcastically, like what code, what book do you think is best for humanity to live by? I say the Bible, what would you say? No, it's an important, it's an important philosophical question. Right?

0 (49m 5s):
I have a book called Not the Bible. Okay. I'm not kidding. There's literally,

1 (49m 9s):
So not loving your neighbor and not like, you know, helping the No, no, there's a lot of good stuff there. Okay.

0 (49m 13s):
But again, it's

1 (49m 14s):
You. Lemme tell you why I'm asking. Well, you're,

0 (49m 16s):
You're cherry picking.

1 (49m 17s):
I I Come on

0 (49m 18s):
Charlie. The

1 (49m 19s):
Story of the Bible, Charlie is one of love and redemption. There's a lot in the Bible. It is, it's a story of love.

0 (49m 25s):
This Old Testament.

1 (49m 26s):
Well, the entire arc of the Bible is a story of love and a need for humans. Redemption.

0 (49m 31s):
Well, that's a charitable way of looking at it. And that's in there. There's a lot of things in there because it's a giant anthology over centuries of many different writers.

1 (49m 40s):
There is a lot in the Bible. There's,

0 (49m 41s):
It wasn't written by God.

1 (49m 42s):
Right. There's a book of the Bible I think you'd love. What song of Solomon?

0 (49m 46s):
Song of Solomon Crosby, souls in Nash

1 (49m 50s):
Song of Solomon's all about sex. So I know it

0 (49m 52s):
Is Yeah. Quote, it

1 (49m 54s):
Can't, it's not, it's not appropriate. No. What? No, it's, it's, it's too dirty for a podcast. No, there, there it's, it literally is about how a husband and wife can grow intimate to one another. And there's, oh,

0 (50m 6s):
Can you tell me that? Can you gimme the cheat sheet on that one? Oh,

1 (50m 9s):
It's, I'm telling you, the Bible has wisdom in ways you might never imagine, bill. But no, what I'm getting at though is that human, this is not a a gotcha. A sarcasm. I mean this like, yeah. Humanity will seek to find a book. They'll seek to find a code to live by. Okay. I, and I think it's incumbent on atheists to tell us what that should be.

0 (50m 27s):
I agree with the first part of that. Humanity will seek to find,

1 (50m 31s):
Seek to know. That's Aristotle's first.

0 (50m 33s):
Well seek to find something that mollifies their feelings. That's different than knowing. No, they don't really care about knowing. They care about mollifying their feelings. I feel empty. What will make me feel better? This book that purports to have answers it couldn't possibly have, but it does make me feel better because now I don't have to wonder about things that are very problematic to worry about. Like, how did I get here And what does it all mean? And why do you know kids get fucking cancer when they're two for no reason.

1 (51m 6s):
And I don't even, I don't have an answer. I'm

0 (51m 8s):
Right. I I know I'm just saying and I acknowledge that. But this book has the answers to that question. Don't ask. Okay, don't ask A and B God works in mysterious ways and that's the end of it. Go to your room.

1 (51m 22s):
I think it's a little deeper than that, but it is, I mean it is deeper. It of course. It's that, Hey, why are we here? Why were we created? But fair enough. I do want to know though, but like, what?

0 (51m 33s):
I don't got it for you. We, we don't have it and we don't claim that. But

1 (51m 37s):
That's a big problem though.

0 (51m 38s):
It's a, it's a, it's a

1 (51m 39s):
Be. And let me pause because yeah, the Bible was the document and as you acknowledged that our founders read and believed that built this beautiful society that you and I both love and I think it's treading on dangerous if we want to a cut our roots without an alternative. Because if we cut our roots, then we get all this other counterfeit stuff of woke him and all this postmodernist garbage. So our contention is, let's go back to where we came from.

0 (52m 9s):
You know who Eugene O'Neal is? No. Eugene O'Neill?

1 (52m 15s):
No.

0 (52m 15s):
Oh wow. Kids today. Giant of American literature theater, A long day's journey in tonight. Have you heard of that play? Never heard of Long Day's Journey in tonight. You kids, what are they doing with you in school?

1 (52m 30s):
I never went to college, bill. This is the problem.

0 (52m 32s):
Okay. Anyway, he once said, a life, I find a life with illusions, unpardonable and a life without illusions. Unbearable. And that's the essence of where we are. You choose the second, I choose the first. I find a life with illusions, unpardonable. I just can't do it. Okay. And you find a life without illusions. Unbearable. And the fact that we can, I think, come to this moment where we go, okay, that's you type A I'm type B, and, and still be friends. I have full, to me, this is the future of where this country has to go.

1 (53m 15s):
I mean, nothing you have said has offended me in slide that appreciate

0 (53m 17s):
It's not some, and I appreciate, and I, I, I appreciate that. Because again, that was my question in religious, how can otherwise really super smart people. But this is the answer. Like, and it, it's,

1 (53m 30s):
Do you, can I interrupt? Yes. Do you doubt those of us that have had religious experiences, do you think it's just like neurological phenomenon?

0 (53m 36s):
What, what do you, how would you define it

1 (53m 38s):
If I say that Jesus changed my life? Yeah. But he's gone to work in my soul.

0 (53m 42s):
Okay. I'm, but was he like getting, did he jump in the car with you at the drive-through? No, but okay. It's, it's what you said, a religious experience. I have to ask how, how much that is.

1 (53m 54s):
There was a moment where I realized that I'm not all that I would ever want to be. That I fall short of the glory of God's wish. And

0 (54m 1s):
When was this?

1 (54m 2s):
When I was in fifth grade, actually, believe it or not, fifth

0 (54m 4s):
Grade. Really?

1 (54m 5s):
Yeah. That's when I gave my life to the Lord.

0 (54m 8s):
You were thinking about this shit in fifth grade.

1 (54m 9s):
Amazingly. Yeah. I went to Christian school. So,

0 (54m 12s):
So you don't see that as indoctrination?

1 (54m 15s):
Well, you know, I actually went to a private school previously, but they didn't force it on us. So their credit

0 (54m 21s):
No, but you said you were in a Christian school. Yeah. Okay. You're 10, you're in a Christian school. There's no connection of like, maybe at a very early age they put a chip in your brain.

1 (54m 32s):
I mean, I still had to make the decision for myself there, by the way. And, and to the cred. And there's a lot of kids that went to that school that aren't Christians anymore. And so,

0 (54m 39s):
By the way, I went to Catholic. I was raised Catholic. I went

1 (54m 42s):
To, didn't, didn't stick.

0 (54m 44s):
I had the opposite reaction to catechism, which was the religious training we would go to on Sunday morning where you would learn how to be a good Catholic. And it just really turned me off to the whole

1 (54m 56s):
Was it too, was it too forceful, too legalistic? Like all

0 (54m 59s):
Of it. I mean, it was just a giant, I mean, I was used to a room with 20 kids in it at regular school. And then on Sunday there's like 60 kids and they're from different schools. And they're just like, they're like, and the nuns were like, mean. 'cause you got 60 kids, you don't really know. You have to like, and of course they're mean to begin with, to like get them in order and, And they scared you And they yelled at you And they hit you with a ruler on the knuckles. I really, I'm from that era where they still like fucking hit you on the,

1 (55m 28s):
You, you know how often I hear the rulers from like, like, I mean, scorned Catholics, the ruler is like a very common thing.

0 (55m 35s):
Again, the idea that you keep people in line, it's by fear. That's why you're keeping people in line. And that's a question that an atheist really, I think is due to ask a religious person. Do you really think fear is the best way for us to grow and become good people? Because if that's how we're doing it, I do have a problem with the methodology. Even if I believed in the religion.

1 (55m 59s):
I hear that from a lot of people that were raised Catholic and No, I do. I'm sorry. It's true.

0 (56m 8s):
It's so true about the Catholic thing. I'm

1 (56m 10s):
Sorry I didn't

0 (56m 10s):
No, no, you're right. It's,

1 (56m 11s):
I didn't mean to, you know, did I do an exorcism or something? Trust me. Like,

0 (56m 15s):
You know, Trust me, we have a whole highlight reels of spit takes. It's the, it's the highlight of any show. If the guest doesn't make,

1 (56m 21s):
If I can make Bill Maher laugh of

0 (56m 22s):
Me, if the guest doesn't make me do a, a spit take, we consider that it's a failure. But, but you did. So go on. But yes, cath Catholics, yes. That's exactly who you would hear that from.

1 (56m 32s):
It's an underemphasis on grace and grace.

0 (56m 35s):
Yeah. What is grace? It's such a vague term.

1 (56m 38s):
So justice is getting what you deserve, which we me personally, anyone? Yeah. We believe all humanity deserves damnation and, and judgment. Tough, tough stuff. And it started in the garden stuff. It the

0 (56m 50s):
Guard. Oh, you believe in the garden. You believe in the Old Testament shit. Oh

1 (56m 54s):
Yeah. No, I'm, I'm

0 (56m 54s):
Right to the,

1 (56m 55s):
I'm one of those Christians

0 (56m 57s):
Like 6,000 years old thing.

1 (56m 58s):
Not necessarily

0 (57m 0s):
Because in religious, I went to see the,

1 (57m 2s):
I'm not necessarily,

0 (57m 3s):
I went to see the museum, you know the museum that they have in

1 (57m 6s):
Oh yeah, yeah. Ken Hams deal.

0 (57m 7s):
Ken Ham. Yes. And we interviewed Ken. He was not happy. You

1 (57m 10s):
Gotta you gotta admit the arc is pretty impressive. Have you seen the arc? They built a whole arc there. We

0 (57m 14s):
Were there for a whole day.

1 (57m 16s):
I don't know. I don't, can't remember if it was before, after the arc.

0 (57m 18s):
No, no, it was. And Jesus, that's impressive. Come on. And Jesus riding the dinosaur.

1 (57m 24s):
Yeah. I don't know about that.

0 (57m 25s):
Jesus riding the dinosaur. Do I really need to elaborate people? Okay, go ahead with your thing.

1 (57m 32s):
Judgment is getting what you deserve. Mercy is getting less What you deserve Grace. Wait,

0 (57m 37s):
Wait. Ju Mercy is getting less than what you do.

1 (57m 39s):
Yeah. So we believe Jesus gives us grace. So you get a prison sentence, you get judgment, you get mercy, you get less of a prison sentence. Grace would be Jesus serving that prison sentence for you so you could live life eternal.

0 (57m 51s):
Well, how, how is he serving it? Oh, you mean like in the big picture?

1 (57m 54s):
Well, because we believe him living a perfect life and then suffering the death that he did on the cross Right. Was him atoning for our sins. Of course, the sins of humanity. Jesus.

0 (58m 6s):
Yeah.

1 (58m 7s):
Which is a big claim, albeit, and a very compelling one, which we also believe one to be true because it redeems all of humanity of our short falling, of the glory of God.

0 (58m 16s):
I gotta say. It's, it's really picking up the check for the whole table. You know? I mean, you gotta you gotta give it to your boy for like, all of our sin. Well, it's, it's a very generous thing.

1 (58m 28s):
But what it does is very generous. It is at its core a statement of human equality. That we're all sinners, we're all screwed up. We all got problems, we all got vices. And like no one, no matter what you do, we all fall short of God's standard. And Jesus makes us whole.

0 (58m 44s):
But how do you think this view of life reflects your politics? And how much should it and how much does it?

1 (58m 54s):
So,

0 (58m 55s):
Look at me, big pothead just turned into a real interviewer.

1 (58m 58s):
I love it. It's, it's a Larry King coming full circle here. There it, you and I both agree there's, it's very difficult to have separation of morality and state.

0 (59m 9s):
Correct.

1 (59m 10s):
So my morals come from the Bible. Right. And that definitely influences my public policy decisions.

0 (59m 17s):
Mine come from Playboy after dark. Is that a problem?

1 (59m 20s):
It's a little bit different than, let's just say the book of Deuteronomy. I'm

0 (59m 27s):
Just fine. Oh, well that's full of crazy

1 (59m 29s):
Shit. Oh, okay.

0 (59m 30s):
Yeah. The book of Deuteronomy.

1 (59m 32s):
Well, there's some good stuff in it.

0 (59m 33s):
That's the one. But that's the,

1 (59m 35s):
I love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength and mind. That's good. Yeah.

0 (59m 38s):
Also like no poking in the wrong hole.

1 (59m 42s):
You're gonna have to ask gay a rabbinic Jew about that.

0 (59m 45s):
Well, there's, there, it's, I think it's Deuteronomy that has, that's

1 (59m 50s):
Leviticus

0 (59m 50s):
Has the

1 (59m 51s):
Do not lie with another man. Right? Yeah. That's Leviticus 19.

0 (59m 55s):
No, and that's not, that is wrong.

1 (59m 56s):
Thou shall not lie with another,

0 (59m 57s):
Do not lie to another man. Because when, if you lie to a gay man, ooh, you are gonna pay for it.

1 (1h 0m 3s):
Well, that's that, that's

0 (1h 0m 4s):
Rough stuff. But lie with another man. That should be everybody's right. Don't you think

1 (1h 0m 9s):
Personally you have, you have a right to, to do what you would like to do personally Yeah.

0 (1h 0m 13s):
With another person.

1 (1h 0m 14s):
But I, as a Christian, do not believe that would be wholly. I think it would be sinful. Yeah.

0 (1h 0m 19s):
But

1 (1h 0m 19s):
Well, but that's just, that's a personal, theo, I don't wanna get too deep, deep, but that's a personal theological.

0 (1h 0m 23s):
No, we need to get a little deeper into this. Okay, fine. Be because it's so important just to understand. Well, let me ask you what you, what you believe. I believe that some people, a decided minority, maybe one out of 20, probably for whatever reason that nature, this perfect nature that you describe as perfect.

1 (1h 0m 46s):
Well, it was designed perfect. It's all screwed up now. Okay. Okay. No, I mean, we, we have disease and we have, you know, all sorts of stuff. Got down syndrome, we got all sorts

0 (1h 0m 55s):
Of problems. Okay. Well then it wasn't designed perfect 'cause it screwed up. Well,

1 (1h 0m 57s):
There was, we, we, you know, you know what we believe, bill? Oh, I see. We believe there was a rebellion and a contamination of nature. Right.

0 (1h 1m 2s):
Because

1 (1h 1m 3s):
That is sin. Right?

0 (1h 1m 4s):
Okay. If they did, hadn't eaten the apple.

1 (1h 1m 7s):
Well, we actually don't know it's an apple, but yes, it's in

0 (1h 1m 10s):
Whatever that it ve

1 (1h 1m 10s):
Have been a mango.

0 (1h 1m 12s):
Well,

1 (1h 1m 13s):
I know. No, don't get me started on mangoes. So

0 (1h 1m 17s):
As they say in West Hollywood, there's nothing like having a mango in your mouth.

1 (1h 1m 21s):
It, it's George Costanza's favorite freak, but yes. So,

0 (1h 1m 24s):
But oh damn. Now what was the point of, you

1 (1h 1m 27s):
Were talking, I know the,

0 (1h 1m 28s):
Tell

1 (1h 1m 28s):
Me something about Deuteronomy. Oh, homosexuality. Is that you wanna

0 (1h 1m 32s):
Talk homosexuality

1 (1h 1m 33s):
As, as we're keeping it, like on the lighter topics.

0 (1h 1m 35s):
Thank you. So about one out of 20 people, maybe even one outta 10, I don't know. And then people will say there's a spectrum. Maybe there's that too. Of course there are, there is. Some people are like, you know what their kids, kids call zesty, you know, not gay, but kind of on the waiting list. Okay. But let's say just gay, like people who are just not attracted to the opposite sex, they're attracted and want to have sex with people of their own sex. Would you agree that that happens in nature?

1 (1h 2m 6s):
Yeah, of course it does. Yes. There, there are instances of species in the animal kingdom that do that. Absolutely. I I, I acknowledge this. Right.

0 (1h 2m 14s):
And we are in the animal kingdom. In fact, we're number one with a bullet. Okay. So given that we both agree that that's a phenomenon that exists,

1 (1h 2m 23s):
There's other things that happen in nature that aren't so good too, but just Yes, that's correct.

0 (1h 2m 28s):
Like on a par with this.

1 (1h 2m 29s):
No, I'm just saying, just to say that it happens in the, the species of the animal kingdom doesn't make it necessarily morally Okay.

0 (1h 2m 37s):
But what's immoral about fucking in the ass. What, what? I don't, I don't understand why the ass in it in itself. Ipso facto is immoral. It's just an ass. And, and the fact that some people want to fuck in there. I've done a million jokes about I don't get that. I mean, it's where the shit comes out. I just don't get it. I'd find if I even thought I was gay, I'd find another way. But that's just me. But they do want to do it. Why is what, why is there an, a moral dimension to this?

1 (1h 3m 8s):
Again, I believe scripture is God breathes. It's what the Bible says.

0 (1h 3m 12s):
Okay. Be because the Bible says, yeah, I

1 (1h 3m 13s):
Do. Correct.

0 (1h 3m 14s):
But you do know, like the, you know, argument from people like me, that kind of logical argument is that, well, these books were really not written by a God. They were written by men. And it reflected,

1 (1h 3m 26s):
Well, of course they were transcribed by men.

0 (1h 3m 27s):
Obviously. It reflected the primitive views of people in that era who would of course have had primitive views. They also didn't understand germs or atoms. So their views on this were primitive. And they believed that there was something wrong with that. That I get it. That it was different than the most of the people in the tribe. That, you know, these two guys are going off and doing it. But that we can, as, as sentient beings now, logical intellectual beings recognize that this was from a long time ago. And now it's just something that happens in nature. That some people want to fuck this way and some people want to fuck this way.

0 (1h 4m 7s):
And there's no moral dimension to it. And no reason to, to call it a sin

1 (1h 4m 12s):
Again. Christianity just disagrees with that. So, I mean, I just, it's the only sin that God has destroy a city over. So, I mean, and I'm not trying to be legalistic about it. No, no. It's just the facts. Right. I think, and it's, it's very, it's explicitly prohibited in the text, by the way. So is adultery and so is stealing. And so is coveting Charlie. Yeah, I'm guilty of coveting. And I mean, we're, we're all guilty of many sins. I'm not trying to single that one out and try to be pompous or

0 (1h 4m 37s):
I think the phrase you're searching for is save your breath. This is what we believe. And I get it's, and in total

1 (1h 4m 44s):
It's it's doctrine. So

0 (1h 4m 45s):
Wait, coveting, what do you mean? Now coveting is one you can't control.

1 (1h 4m 50s):
No, that's not true.

0 (1h 4m 51s):
Oh, stop it. You can control coveting. It's like saying you can control, if I say, don't ever think of a pink elephant, you will think of a pink elephant.

1 (1h 4m 59s):
It's a little bit more than thinking. I would, I would, we would say in the interpretation of coveting, it's to the place where you become obsessed. Oh, it takes your being.

0 (1h 5m 8s):
No. Oh no, that's coveting. I thought coveting was just wanting something you don't have. Well,

1 (1h 5m 13s):
We, that's of course, you can't regulate every thought that you have. Coing gets to the place where it becomes your identity. Oh, of obsession. Oh, oh, well that and that, let me tell you why. 'cause it says do not cover a specific thing. Your, your, your neighbor's wife. You know, your donkey. So it's like a very specific thing. So for example, if like, you know, someone says, I want to be, I, I can't stand Bill Maher. I wanna be a comedian as successful as Bill Maher. It becomes their identity. I don't think that's good. I think it, I think it ruins your soul. I think you would agree with that too. You know, people like that. Don't

0 (1h 5m 43s):
Give them any ideas.

1 (1h 5m 44s):
No, come on. I

0 (1h 5m 45s):
Mean, they're already there

1 (1h 5m 46s):
Drunk. But people that are consumed with, you know, jealousy. Totally. That's what we would say is totally not just like, oh, don't think of the pink elephant. Totally. I'm not here to

0 (1h 5m 54s):
Okay.

1 (1h 5m 54s):
Play air traffic control in your thoughts. Right,

0 (1h 5m 57s):
Right. Because, you know, you're an attractive guy. I'm sure. I'm sure there's lots of maga groupies and I'm sure coveting comes up, you know, how can you not covet? You know,

1 (1h 6m 9s):
And, and praise God that I have a great wife. Right. And, you

0 (1h 6m 13s):
Know, she understands about the covenant.

1 (1h 6m 15s):
Yeah. And we're, we have a, a very healthy, loyal, you know, wonderful marriage and look. Right. But male nature is, that's why there had to be a prohibition on adultery because it is male nature to No,

0 (1h 6m 26s):
It's, it's, I think it's actually easier to be a female in that way.

1 (1h 6m 31s):
I completely agree.

0 (1h 6m 32s):
Right. I covet being a female.

1 (1h 6m 34s):
I, I wouldn't go that, I wouldn't go that far. But

0 (1h 6m 36s):
How wrong is that?

1 (1h 6m 37s):
I'm, but no, and again, it's, and again, good on you for being a liberal that acknowledges male female distinctions. What a concept. Right? Oh, of course. I mean,

0 (1h 6m 45s):
Of all the low lying fruit that the Democrats just like hand the Republicans to win elections. That's the

1 (1h 6m 52s):
One, you know, it's so funny, I joked around with my team the other day. I said, are they really gonna just let us win every national election on this no men and female sports thing? Right. Like, they can't surrender on this one issue. It's

0 (1h 7m 2s):
So

1 (1h 7m 2s):
Ridiculous. It's a 90 10 issue. Yeah. There's 890 medals in Trump. I mean, of men winning these competitions. You

0 (1h 7m 8s):
Lost Gavin Newsom on this. Okay. Take that as a hint, right? I mean, you were, I think you were on,

1 (1h 7m 14s):
I was the one that asked the question.

0 (1h 7m 15s):
Right? Yeah. No, that's,

1 (1h 7m 17s):
And you said issue of fairness all day.

0 (1h 7m 18s):
Well, that's what I started to say when you sat down, you're everywhere now. You're Gavin New everybody's podcast. And, and you know, look, I always say this, everybody's a monster till you talk to them. Not to say that there aren't some people who probably are monsters, but like, I mean, I've yet to find the horror show That is you. So let me

1 (1h 7m 44s):
Keep looking, bill.

0 (1h 7m 45s):
No, I want to,

1 (1h 7m 47s):
You got you. Just, you gotta keep going.

0 (1h 7m 49s):
I do. I want you gotta deeper. So take deeper me. Cut me, cut me some slack. 'cause we're friends now. Right? Right. We

1 (1h 7m 55s):
Really are.

0 (1h 7m 56s):
Absolutely. Okay. So just cut to the chase. What is it that the 10% who hate me? Oh yeah. Tell me what they are wanting me to press you on that. What is the thing that presses their buttons the most about why your incorrigibles

1 (1h 8m 13s):
Dick? I don't even think you would agree with their accusations

0 (1h 8m 15s):
Then, but I just want to know what it

1 (1h 8m 16s):
Is. They would say I'm hateful. They would say I'm a bigot. They would say that I'm a xenophobe. They would, that those are the contentions that I get.

0 (1h 8m 24s):
But based on what things that you've said

1 (1h 8m 26s):
Specifically. I mean, I believe that transgenderism is a mental disorder as it was, you know, diagnosed in the

0 (1h 8m 33s):
So you don't think any people are like born quote unquote in the wrong body?

1 (1h 8m 37s):
No, I, I don't agree. No. I think people might think they're born in a different body, but I, I believe it to be a mental disorder as most of clinicians did up until the last five or 10 years. Well,

0 (1h 8m 47s):
You know, this is another one where the woke Kates me. I mean, I did a whole thing on how I think, and we, we do disagree on this by the way. 'cause I do think there is such a thing. Fair enough being born in the wrong body. But I said what's going on in the country is, is what I would call entrapment. Because entrapment by legal means is when you suggest to people something they really wouldn't have done anyway. And I use the example of the Liberty seven, the seven African American gentlemen in Miami Okay. Who were planning to blow up the Sears Tower. They were not the FBI came in Yep. To seven people who were probably had good reason to be discontented with America and said, wouldn't it be great if we blew up the Sears Tower in Chicago Fora?

0 (1h 9m 30s):
And they were like, yeah. And they they didn't even have a gun. That's entrapment. And I think

1 (1h 9m 36s):
Or the Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping case similarly. Yeah. No, that's real. No, that's legit.

0 (1h 9m 40s):
Oh, the kidnapping. No,

1 (1h 9m 41s):
That was, that was, that was entrapment.

0 (1h 9m 43s):
So she really wasn't

1 (1h 9m 44s):
No, no, that was an FBI entrapment thing. Absolutely. Oh, it was? Oh yeah. It was like, it was like eight. It was like five feds and two guys. Anyway, we don't have to get, we don't have to

0 (1h 9m 51s):
For, for the record, I'm not acknowledging that I agree with that because I just don't know off about it

1 (1h 9m 56s):
In the comments. You guys can agree

0 (1h 9m 57s):
Or disagree. I'm just acknowledging that I respect Charlie Kirk enough to look into whether that is, and, and it could be true because I say it all the time. I don't believe anybody. Like I, you, you just lost my trust all media. Right. Left very few people. I'm right there with you. Do I have like, okay, I hear what you're saying. Now I have to go vet it

1 (1h 10m 22s):
Hilariously more people that I know that are center left now say, I think Trump is not a monster because Bill Maher of what he said on anything else.

0 (1h 10m 31s):
Well, I didn't exactly say that. Said, well,

1 (1h 10m 33s):
No, you said not a crazy person lives in the White House. That was what you said. Right. And you said he was respectful and gregarious.

0 (1h 10m 38s):
Right. A person. Yes. I said not a crazy, but a person who acts crazy on the public state. But

1 (1h 10m 42s):
Those are two different things though.

0 (1h 10m 43s):
I know, but that's what matters. I also said it doesn't matter what it, what he does in a private dinner with a comedian, what matters is who he's on the world stage. What bothers me about the critiques I get is that they don't acknowledge the points I I I myself made. Fair

1 (1h 10m 59s):
Enough. Let me ask you. No, I don't mean you No, no, no, no. But would you prefer him to be crazy and private or crazy in public? I'm just, let's just say, I'm not saying he's crazy directly. I

0 (1h 11m 6s):
Just, I just took it as a positive. And I said this also, I took it as a positive that at least there is this other person No. That I see that is not, is undeniable. And again, for all the people who we're losing truth, yes. I was one of the first to say that we are losing truth. Okay. But I told you the truth. That's all I did. I went there and I told the truth of what happened. Would you have and good for you? And they pr they would that I had lied. I assumed

1 (1h 11m 33s):
Did you sign the bill Ma Accords? It was like a Exactly. It was like the ratification

0 (1h 11m 37s):
Of a treaty. But, but, but he signed that piece of, I

1 (1h 11m 39s):
Thought that was hilarious. It

0 (1h 11m 40s):
Is hilarious.

1 (1h 11m 41s):
It's like you guys were negotiating. First

0 (1h 11m 42s):
Of all, the thing I did was so fucking, fucking funny. You gimme a little credit

1 (1h 11m 46s):
For me, I sign the thing. No,

0 (1h 11m 47s):
But the whole piece I did on my show was thought

1 (1h 11m 50s):
Hysteric, thought, I thought it was terrific. Yeah.

0 (1h 11m 51s):
It was funny. And

1 (1h 11m 52s):
Honestly good for President Trump for hosting you and Right. He had the magnanimity to do that. Right.

0 (1h 11m 57s):
And, and listening. And again, the reason why I was the perfect choice for this was because I, nobody had been harder. So it on him. So it was a real Nixon to China thing. And by the way, if you don't know what Nixon to China means, you probably shouldn't be commenting on political matters to begin with. That's right. My critical friends,

1 (1h 12m 20s):
I what your meeting I thought was a great window into the whole liberal world that shows the Donald Trump that I know and the, that I've gotten to know, which is, and I, I just thought it was hilarious when he was, you know, asking you about Iran. Right. He'll ask anybody about anything. He loves asking people's opinion. Right. He listens more than he talks. Right.

0 (1h 12m 42s):
He'll

1 (1h 12m 42s):
Solicit opinions. I know. It blows people's minds when we say this. Well, it

0 (1h 12m 46s):
Also blows our minds because then he doesn't do the right thing. You know,

1 (1h 12m 50s):
Sometimes he does, sometimes he does. The amte of Jerusalem is security.

0 (1h 12m 53s):
I list. I know you have. I gave that whole list. So you I also gave the list of did things that are, that are horrible, disappearing people and ignoring judges and, and gutting the government with glee. This tariff thing that even the conservative press has turned him on, turned off on. So yeah, it was, it was just honest down the line on both sides. Do

1 (1h 13m 18s):
You, do you feel,

0 (1h 13m 18s):
I just told you what I saw and good for you and didn't, and I just told this to Harvey Levi on his show, I'm proud. I looked him in the eye and said, you're scaring people. I'm proud. I looked him in the eye and said, how

1 (1h 13m 30s):
Did he react to that?

0 (1h 13m 32s):
You know, I said

1 (1h 13m 33s):
That. No,

0 (1h 13m 33s):
I mean, I'm not, I I know, but, but see, that's the thing. I, I said that the night I gave it. I said, I you're scaring people. Why do you wanna scare your own citizens so much? And I know everybody wants to know what he said. And the truth is, I don't remember. But it wasn't

1 (1h 13m 49s):
What kind of drugs were you guys doing that night?

0 (1h 13m 52s):
But it wasn't Okay, I'll stop.

1 (1h 13m 54s):
Okay, then you would've remembered

0 (1h 13m 55s):
That. I would've remembered. So I have no illusions that, you know, my dinner with Donald Trump is gonna change the nation, but to the, to the haters, it's just like, as opposed to what not engaging at all. That's,

1 (1h 14m 10s):
That is that is their,

0 (1h 14m 11s):
It's either me or, or Gretchen Whitmer with the, with the binders hiding her face. She's hiding. I mean, I feel like I did it better. I went in there. I didn't give one inch on what I believe or, or sang to his face what I believe. But, you know, I told the truth about how he's different and private.

1 (1h 14m 33s):
Do you think, why, what do you think about the idea you going, here's how I would frame, frame it. You going to meet with Trump would be the equivalent of Biden inviting me over for dinner. Yeah. Meaning, like, is that fair? Absolutely. Okay. I don't wanna put words in your mouth. Absolutely. Why do you think Biden or Obama wouldn't do that? And Trump did.

0 (1h 14m 49s):
I mentioned that too in the thing. I said, you know what you did.

1 (1h 14m 52s):
But

0 (1h 14m 52s):
I, I said, you know, because look, this was kind of a guy's dinner and I look Donald Trump is a man of a certain age, of a certain way of life. I just think he's comfortable with the guys. Not I, and I also think he loves his wife more than his let on. But like, he just likes being with the guys. And it was a guy's dinner and we just had a good guy's time. And so like the, I said it like, I voted for Obama, I voted for Clinton. But the idea that I could talk to them as freely as I felt this conversation was going is, is emblematic to me of why the Democrats lose the elections. Because they just don't feel that this is like a real person.

0 (1h 15m 34s):
And I know it's so weird to say that about Donald Trump, who I've said a gillion times is, you know, a whiny little bitch. I mean, I could go through my greatest hits of like, insults, but this was about getting past that and maybe seeing that if we met in person, we don't hate each other as much. And we don't. And I don't, and I'm sorry, I'm not gonna like pretend that's a bad thing.

1 (1h 15m 56s):
No. It's how you heal as a

0 (1h 15m 57s):
Country. Even though he's doing terrible things,

1 (1h 16m 0s):
I would say doing great things. But that's, that's a separate issue. But

0 (1h 16m 4s):
I mean, sending American citizens to foreign prisons,

1 (1h 16m 8s):
He didn't do that. That was

0 (1h 16m 10s):
A one liner. I know. He set a one liner. You're so forgiving.

1 (1h 16m 15s):
I am. That's, that's, that's the Christ in me.

0 (1h 16m 17s):
I know. But it's

1 (1h 16m 18s):
Jesus, you, you need Jesus bill again. And there'll be more forgiving.

0 (1h 16m 20s):
You wouldn't have been forgiving if Obama said it.

1 (1h 16m 23s):
Well, if so, just let's speak. What, so what did Trump's Trump said that the homegrown ones, you could also argue that if it's an illegal alien, homegrown, I don't even wanna get too far deep into it. Let's just say you were, I don't think we should ever entertain American citizens going to prisons abroad.

0 (1h 16m 40s):
Right. Because I mean, you're a student of American history.

1 (1h 16m 45s):
I try. Yeah.

0 (1h 16m 46s):
I

1 (1h 16m 46s):
Don't know who Eugene O'Neill is, but,

0 (1h 16m 49s):
Well, that's not history. That's the arts. And that's the 20th century. But yes, I'm happy to fill the gaps in your knowledge. Thank you. That's a big one. Eugene O'Neill's big. You I would not like.

1 (1h 16m 59s):
No, no, no. It's like I,

0 (1h 17m 0s):
He's not like this some small guy, but, okay. So the iceman cometh another big one. But iceman, you can see it's not recent, but, oh, I forget now what we're talking about. It's the pot. I blame the pot, Charlie. It's always the pot. You're right. It's terrible. I'm gonna quit tomorrow. Not really.

1 (1h 17m 20s):
It it, it sharpens your memory, doesn't it?

0 (1h 17m 22s):
What do you think would happen if you smoked pot?

1 (1h 17m 24s):
Oh my goodness.

0 (1h 17m 25s):
You never did. No. Even as a kid. No. But what seems just the, this is like sort of my version of the religion thing. Like maybe you're missing out on the big picture the way I am with Christianity. Maybe. Except I've already been exposed to Christianity and you've never been exposed to Rastafarianism or whatever. My religion

1 (1h 17m 45s):
Is. Only one of those has an afterlife. But

0 (1h 17m 47s):
But you could, I mean, don't you, don't you think that it's a, would be a great thing to see corners of your mind that you have never looked into?

1 (1h 17m 57s):
Tell me more. What, what happened? What do you mean by that? I'm not, it's not a game I wanna, like, I No,

0 (1h 18m 2s):
I will tell you. I'm happy to tell you. I'll put it this way. I've mentioned this before with potheads. I think on my show that when I have an important decision to make, I treat my mind the way Congress is designed, a bicameral institution. I will think about its sober and I will think about it stoned. And then if they agree, they can reconcile and present a bill and I will sign it.

1 (1h 18m 32s):
And there's a reconciliation process.

0 (1h 18m 34s):
But they both have to come agree on this because I just have a different perspective when I'm stoned. And it's very often sharper and more insightful and better. You know, I mean, just editing, I know like just writing in general, but I mean, I don't do all my writing stone, but like the final edit, it's like, oh yeah, you're right. That should go like things I did not see sober. I will see stoned. And you know, you might get stoned and be like, oh Jesus, what are we kidding?

0 (1h 19m 16s):
Come back from the dead. No, I'm kidding. This is sun. So Sundays Easter. What are you gonna do? Must be a big day. He has risen.

1 (1h 19m 24s):
He has risen indeed. Bill, we're gonna be celebrating the resurrection of our Lord.

0 (1h 19m 27s):
No. Why do we say that in the present tense?

1 (1h 19m 30s):
He 'cause it is a, it is a constant truth in our life. He is

0 (1h 19m 33s):
Risen. I always noticed that, that that was interesting to me. That it was,

1 (1h 19m 36s):
That's a really important question actually. It

0 (1h 19m 38s):
Is. Tell me.

1 (1h 19m 40s):
Well, because the fact that he has risen transcend time, it's not just in the present sense. It's that of all time. That promise is accessible to all of us. And so it, it's a proclamation to all people. 'cause if you said, Hey, he was risen, eh, it's like, it's just merely a historical event. It almost underplays the metaphysics of it.

0 (1h 20m 1s):
I'm just always fascinated the way really, really fine intellectual minds employ themselves for the purpose of arguing things that are so inarguable. It's almost, it does fascinating though. It's almost, it's al it does because it's, it's almost like a, it's almost like a challenge. Like, I'm so smart that I can make this thing, which is so fucking stupid. Not stupid. It seems like a real stupid, I'm I'm kidding. No, no, it's fine. No, but you, you get where I'm coming from. Like, I'm gonna take something that is so anti-intellectual, even though I can argue like an intellect,

1 (1h 20m 38s):
However. But you have to acknowledge even the greatest minds of history have been mesmerized by the scriptures. Isaac Newton, Thomas Aquinas. Well, Isaac Newton wrote more about biblical prophecy than even physics. And so there's something about the scriptures Yeah. That are intellectual, that does push your limits. And that's what I think is so beautiful about our faith is it can be accessible to everyone, but also infinitely nourishing and exploration.

0 (1h 21m 3s):
So why the, if there's this other truth that's beyond this meta, you know, this metaphysical truth, why so many different versions of it that only seem to cause wars. You know, Protestants and Catholics,

1 (1h 21m 20s):
Eastern Orthodox Mormon,

0 (1h 21m 22s):
Someone asked me recently, like, you know, like, I won't say who, but sometimes people have, you know, don't know history that well. And they're like, bill, like, okay, so Columbus 1492 lands on America and we don't really then have the first colony until 1607 Jamestown. So somebody said to me, what happened in that century? You know, what happened in that century? Martin Luther at the beginning of that century said there's an alternative to Catholicism.

1 (1h 21m 59s):
It was 95 theses that were

0 (1h 22m 1s):
Not nailed on the door of Wittenberg in 1517. And for the next a hundred years, they just fucking killed each other all over Europe about who was right about that. And that's why it took a century after Columbus landed to go back. 'cause they were preoccupied with killing each other over whether the pope in Rome was the devil. And you know, and then, and then, or

1 (1h 22m 29s):
Is the Eucharist the little robot in body of Christ?

0 (1h 22m 32s):
I mean, did his foreskin ascend to heaven with him? Or was that left ear? 'cause he was a Jew. I mean, there was just a lot of silly

1 (1h 22m 39s):
Questions. There was a lot of debates.

0 (1h 22m 40s):
Arianism remember that from the,

1 (1h 22m 42s):
I'm sure. Yeah. Or dualism. Or modalism, right. Or I mean the whole but the,

0 (1h 22m 46s):
The,

1 (1h 22m 47s):
The, how do we come to Trinitarianism as a whole?

0 (1h 22m 49s):
I find the, I find the first few centuries of Christianity the most fascinating. Tell me

1 (1h 22m 56s):
Why.

0 (1h 22m 56s):
Well, because they were deciding on it. Yeah. I mean Christianity for you non history majors. Christ dies in 33. Of course. And then it wasn't until three centuries later around

1 (1h 23m 8s):
Council of Naia,

0 (1h 23m 9s):
Well that's even later. But the three 30 I think, oh, may or maybe that was when the Emperor Constantine declared that.

1 (1h 23m 16s):
Was he, he he he convened. Okay. The council of Nice.

0 (1h 23m 18s):
Right. Okay. So that's when Christianity becomes the official religion of the Roman Empire. So it took 300 years

1 (1h 23m 24s):
And then, and that's when the Nicean creed was creed. Right.

0 (1h 23m 26s):
Right. And, and, and in those 300 years, there

1 (1h 23m 30s):
Were a ton of debates. First

0 (1h 23m 31s):
It was like, you know, the Christianity was just persecuted. You know, the,

1 (1h 23m 37s):
It was surviving the first a hundred years, the

0 (1h 23m 38s):
Blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church was said by Telian in 2 0 2. So that's 200 years into it. And they were still martyrs. You know, they were fed to the lions that shit. And then slowly it catches on the idea that it gets good. And the afterlife was very attractive to an empire that was like a lot of slaves. You're a slave. This is a good deal. And so finally in three 30 it becomes the official religion. But, and then you have the church fathers Ambrose.

1 (1h 24m 11s):
Augustine, both

0 (1h 24m 12s):
Augustine. Right. And Jerome and Aus Augustine is writing in like four 30, I think the city

1 (1h 24m 20s):
Of God.

0 (1h 24m 21s):
Yes. He's writing in the, in the city of Hippo. And you know, just the way they, the, I don't want to call them exactly press agents, but kind of the way they formed the idea of the church in those early centuries, you know, it was something that needed

1 (1h 24m 42s):
What needed. It needed decisions to be made. 'cause when you, our answer would be, which I don't think you'll find overly persuasive. See, I was gonna do it right when you were swallowing, is that when you have something true, you have a lot of bad forces that try to pervert it. And you got, you have to, you have to be able to, you have to meet, you have to refine it. You have to clarify it. And I mean, the idea of the trinity was one of the most important, one of those debates. Again, you had dualism, modalism, arianism, you had, I mean you had gnosticism, which was a huge debate Yes. Of the early church. And of course the was concluded in Trinitarianism, which I I we would, and we would argue, go ahead.

0 (1h 25m 21s):
It's just so much arguing that's about how many angels are on the head of a pin.

1 (1h 25m 26s):
That's, that's just, it's that, that wasn't the ar the arguments were much more Well, it's consequential than even like Yeah,

0 (1h 25m 34s):
I guess if you believe

1 (1h 25m 35s):
Eschatology, right?

0 (1h 25m 36s):
Yeah. If you, you know, there's an old saying in comedy by the premise, by the bit, if you believe the premise that he is God and the all the no, that wasn't, then you then you care the big, whether the foreskin went with him or not. The big

1 (1h 25m 47s):
Debate was like, is Christ God. That was the big one. That was the biggest of them all. And it nearly split the church in five different parts. And the idea of the trinity was eventually decided upon which we believe to be

0 (1h 26m 0s):
In religious. I went to a holy land And they have the Jesus there 'cause they reenact the whole crucifixion. And so I interviewed Jesus. And you know, I hit 'em with that about like, you know, it's supposed to be very proud. They're very proud that they're mono monotheistic. You know, like the pagan people. They have many God, these are these fucking heathens, these savages.

1 (1h 26m 22s):
The river, the sun.

0 (1h 26m 23s):
Yes. From shithole trees, the corn,

1 (1h 26m 24s):
The dirt. Right.

0 (1h 26m 26s):
Crazy people with so many gods. And then you have the Father, the son, the Holy Ghost. You can pray to the mother. I mean, it's just a lot of people involved.

1 (1h 26m 35s):
It's one godhead in three parts. The Trinity's very complex.

0 (1h 26m 37s):
And so this is when Jesus said, oh

1 (1h 26m 39s):
Yeah, tell me what he said. Yeah.

0 (1h 26m 40s):
He said, he said, and this like stopped me in my tracks for a minute. 'cause it's the kind of bullshit that makes you go, you know, that makes people go, oh. And to me it wouldn't make, oh no. Okay, so he said it's like ice.

1 (1h 26m 54s):
I took water. Yeah. It's in three parts. Yeah. Water vapor. Water or ice. So I'm glad I didn't use that one on you. You wouldn't have liked it.

0 (1h 27m 1s):
Well, Jesus already tried

1 (1h 27m 2s):
It. Did he say it? Er is the real

0 (1h 27m 4s):
Question. Right. But it's pretty, it's a pretty good analogy.

1 (1h 27m 6s):
No, but that's what we would say. It's the same thing in three different parts. Right.

0 (1h 27m 10s):
But you know, they did add the Holy Ghost like three centuries in because the church needed another quote.

1 (1h 27m 15s):
Well, that's not true. Oh, it is true.

0 (1h 27m 16s):
There was no Holy Ghost in the beginning.

1 (1h 27m 18s):
In, in Matthew four, Christ is baptized and it says the Spirit came upon him. God. F Father says, it's my son and I'm pleased. And he's the son. So you have all three parts of the Godhead right there.

0 (1h 27m 30s):
The Holy Ghost is named there. The

1 (1h 27m 31s):
Spirit. It says the Spirit of the Lord came upon him. Now it doesn't use

0 (1h 27m 35s):
The, that sounds like the Lord.

1 (1h 27m 36s):
Well then, then God the Father said, this is my son and who I am Please. So three distinct parts of the Godhead. It's the best picture of the Trinity we have. And then in the Book of Acts. So

0 (1h 27m 45s):
They were all in the same room at the same time. Well,

1 (1h 27m 47s):
In the river, right. I mean the, the scene right.

0 (1h 27m 49s):
God the Father was there.

1 (1h 27m 50s):
God the Father was audible. Right?

0 (1h 27m 52s):
Audible. Oh, so he was on Zoom.

1 (1h 27m 55s):
Yeah. He was, he was phoning it in, Christ was being baptized by John the Baptizer and the spirit of the Lord

0 (1h 28m 1s):
Baptizer John the Baptist.

1 (1h 28m 3s):
It's actually Baptizer. Yeah,

0 (1h 28m 4s):
That's what they call him now. Yeah. Yeah. Is that new? You

1 (1h 28m 7s):
Gotta keep up with the time.

0 (1h 28m 7s):
I mean, I Is that new? It's,

1 (1h 28m 9s):
It's, it's, it's a, it's a fun wonky theological.

0 (1h 28m 12s):
Why did they change it? Because

1 (1h 28m 14s):
It was actually in the, again, this is like, so what's

0 (1h 28m 17s):
Wrong with John the Baptist?

1 (1h 28m 17s):
It's so insignificant because it actually, in the old Greek, it was a verb. It was the Baptizer, the one, it's completely irrelevant. It doesn't matter.

0 (1h 28m 25s):
It's like new Coke. Stick with what works. You know what, it was great. John the Baptist. There's nothing wrong with John the Baptist. It's a great title.

1 (1h 28m 33s):
And then in Acts it says the spirit of the Lord came upon the disciples at Pentecost.

0 (1h 28m 39s):
Well, I can't tell you how much I enjoy this. Well, thank you. I mean, again, I,

1 (1h 28m 43s):
And I I I don't,

0 (1h 28m 44s):
I'm sure there's something that I'm not asking you that I should,

1 (1h 28m 47s):
I've been admire builders for a while. We we're on different planets, obviously on the spiritual, religious stuff. But when you spoke against the woke, that for me was a proving moment. No, no. And I have to say something. And this is a hundred percent true. You had more moral courage than pastors that I know that went along with the world Crazy train. And you deserve credit for that. I appreciate that. 'cause it was of high cost.

0 (1h 29m 7s):
Until we get rid of that shit, they're never gonna win another election.

1 (1h 29m 12s):
I agree. They don't, they're not gonna take political advice from me.

0 (1h 29m 14s):
No. But they might from me. They could not. Not, And they should, but not, not the 10%, but that's 10%.

1 (1h 29m 21s):
But they're very loud.

0 (1h 29m 22s):
They're very loud. But, but that's it. And, and and I, you know, as FDR once said, I welcome their hatred because they're just, they, first of all, they have no integrity. They don't like ever like, present the full argument. They they, they just cherry pick. I mean, everybody does it to everybody. So I'm not saying I'm unique here, but that is part of our, the problem, our of our discourse is that everybody just wants to forward their narrative. No one is really interested in the full truth. Just just the truth. Just gimme the truth. And that's the crowd I'm going for. Yes. You know, and

1 (1h 30m 2s):
And to be honest, when I go to these campuses and we're drawing these huge crowds, in some ways, we're benefiting from the ways that the old school comics would benefit on college campuses. 'cause we're saying the stuff you're not allowed to say. Like we are the rebellion type energy. They

0 (1h 30m 16s):
Must be so thirsty for it.

1 (1h 30m 18s):
Of course. And like the most they're kids. Yes.

0 (1h 30m 21s):
It's like innate that they want to be at. Here's something that's not politically correct.

1 (1h 30m 26s):
Yes. And, and you think about it, it's like you're a guy on a college campus at any one of these tour stops. We're going to, right. Boise State, university of South Carolina Oak, you know, Oklahoma State University. And they are constantly in this bubble of, if I say one wrong word, I could have my entire career ruined. If I say the wrong joke, if I laugh at the wrong thing, if I use the wrong pronoun, they're, they're living in a totalitarian environment. A cultural totalitarian one. Okay.

0 (1h 30m 51s):
You're gonna have to stay a little more. 'cause I want to ask you about this. 'cause now you got me oncologist and you know, I've been, that's been one of my big

1 (1h 30m 56s):
No, no, we gotta talk about this

0 (1h 30m 57s):
Fucking, that's been one of my big fucking targets. Big time. I mean, I've got, it was in my book, it was in my special, I called them the mouth of the river from which all the nonsense flows.

1 (1h 31m 8s):
It it is the Wuhan laboratory. That's

0 (1h 31m 11s):
Was my

1 (1h 31m 11s):
So the woke, yeah, I probably got it from you. I,

0 (1h 31m 14s):
I did, I said, if ignorance is a disease, Harvard yard is the Wuhan wet market. That was my joke I

1 (1h 31m 20s):
Got, now we can say Wuhan lab, but Yeah, that's

0 (1h 31m 23s):
Right. Yeah. Okay. And Trump's going after the colleges now, which

1 (1h 31m 29s):
I fully support.

0 (1h 31m 31s):
Yeah. But as always with his shit, it's like, it's not exactly legal the way he's doing it. You know, it's, it's coercive. It's, I get that. I, I am behind the, the, the feeling of it. I'm not sure this is the way to do it, but the feeling of it, yes. They, they have become places that, and this is again, one of your big bail. You know, this is one of the places you really got to. And I think this has helped you get where you are. They have become places that, that are two things.

0 (1h 32m 11s):
Not really interested in teaching, just, just getting a, a point of view on the world into the kids' heads, which is not the way it was when I went to college at all. And also just very anti-Western civilization. Completely. And this is western civilization. And you live in western civilization. You're soaking in it. You are enjoying it. Yes. All the things that make your life, and especially the life of minorities and oppressed people better come from western civilization. Rule of law, scientific inquiry, freedom of, freedom of speech, democracy, all the thing, women's rights, gay rights,

1 (1h 32m 57s):
All of it.

0 (1h 32m 58s):
All of it is western civilization. And the question is, how do you like extra paint that from universities without, I mean, going after the research money, it has nothing to do with this.

1 (1h 33m 15s):
It doesn't, it doesn't. I mean, so first of all, you're right. Let's just start with our agreement. Colleges have become a place where they want everyone to look different, but think the same. Their idea of diversity is like, okay, we look at the yearbook vote and everyone has exactly, you know, race, diversity, everything

0 (1h 33m 30s):
Has to look like Angelina Jolie's Christmas card.

1 (1h 33m 35s):
But they all, they all think the as if they're at the Democrat National committee meeting. Right. There is no diversity of thought. There's no heterodox opinion. They tried to get Western civilization taught at Stanford, you know, this story well over 15 to 20 years ago. And they removed it. They removed it from the core curriculum.

0 (1h 33m 52s):
Really?

1 (1h 33m 53s):
I'm gonna be honest, these places have to be basically burned to the ground. They, they're,

0 (1h 33m 57s):
We'll say this

1 (1h 33m 59s):
Metaphorically.

0 (1h 33m 60s):
Okay. Metaphorically. Yeah. Well

1 (1h 34m 2s):
Meaning like, I mean, look, you have take Harvard. So you say the re research money, first of all, they take 10 to 15% of that in overhead. Why does Harvard with a $50 billion endowment need $2 billion in research money? Just ask

0 (1h 34m 14s):
Hardly the same question.

1 (1h 34m 15s):
That's a hedge fund with a college attached. Right? That's not, that's not a university. Right. Right. I mean, that, that's something completely different. Stanford, $40 billion endowment. Yeah. Yale, $35 billion endowment. And look, some of this research is awesome. And I got, I gotta agree with you, some of it, they should go do a case by case basis. But a lot of it though is this woke stuff that would like take your breath away. I mean, research into transgender mice. I mean, it was this, the US taxpayer dollars be

0 (1h 34m 41s):
Funding that. Well, that, see, I called that out on my show. That was bullshit. It wasn't transgender. See, that worries me about you, Charlie. You seem to have swallowed that one whole, like a snake does a mouse without looking into it. It was transgenic.

1 (1h 34m 58s):
Oh, I'm sorry.

0 (1h 34m 59s):
It was not, but it's hugely different. Transgender that's just going along with what the mob thinks. It wasn't, he got it wrong and no one was around to tell him that he got it wrong. He just went with it. Transgender. It wasn't transgender, it was transgenic. They were studying mice for health reasons, serious cancer solving reasons, nothing to do with transgender. So

1 (1h 35m 27s):
I, I stand corrected on that.

0 (1h 35m 29s):
Okay. But,

1 (1h 35m 31s):
But a lot of these universities have superfluous research departments that are bloated and then go raise your own money for it is my, is my position. If you wanna go do this stuff, go raise your

0 (1h 35m 42s):
Money. Absolutely. No, of course. So as Christian as you are, you don't want us to be the Christian United States of America.

1 (1h 35m 48s):
I want to see the body politic become Christian. But I want the Constitution to be our North star,

0 (1h 35m 53s):
Not by coercion.

1 (1h 35m 54s):
No. Because that's not love. That's force. Okay. We as Christians believe you should voluntarily use your agency, give your life to Christ.

0 (1h 36m 2s):
And, and you, and you think that someday we all will like, get on the train there.

1 (1h 36m 9s):
I I I don't know if I'm optimistic or pess. I don't know. It's tough. I the church rates are going down. Right. I mean, we are seeing a little bit of a plateauing there. Your side's been winning Bill the last 20 years.

0 (1h 36m 20s):
You know, you're gonna be tired of all the winning. That's all I'm gonna say.

1 (1h 36m 24s):
But like, and as are you cheering for those church rates to go down?

0 (1h 36m 29s):
Yes.

1 (1h 36m 30s):
You think it would make the world a better place? I do. Has it made Europe better?

0 (1h 36m 32s):
The idea that you think we need Christianity as the pillar here to hold up this edifice I that I can't agree with.

1 (1h 36m 41s):
I I, but I think you could agree that there's a Christian inheritance that is unique and that's Tom Holland's argument. Who's, who's an atheist. That's true. And that, that there's something we've inherited of na these

0 (1h 36m 51s):
Well, there's no, well, what we do know is that the ideas of the enlightenment were ideas from people who were Christian. I mean, we were, you know, the, the obviously Sau and John Locke and the people here in America

1 (1h 37m 5s):
Was very Christian. Gave us Yeah. Enlight

0 (1h 37m 7s):
Christian, I mean Christianity to varying degrees. Again, deism again, you know, Thomas Jefferson taking Jesus out of his miracles out of the Bible. So there was, but that's the basic tradition. It is a western tradition that we seem to have to always apologize for. I'm sorry.

1 (1h 37m 23s):
No, no, no. I'm

0 (1h 37m 24s):
Not. No, I'm, I'm joking. I'm

1 (1h 37m 25s):
Saying, but no, if, if Amer, if America was 81% Christian or 81% Islamic, which, which what? What's a better country?

0 (1h 37m 34s):
Yes. According to the ideals I believe in. If you think faith, I know you do is the most important thing. But I happen to think freedom is the most important thing. Personal liberty, again, human rights, rule of law, scientific inquiry, democracy, freedom of speech, all these things which are absent much more in those societies than the society I live in. Totally. All right, Charlie. Okay. Charlie, bill, thank you. That was a real, it was a pleasure. Real fun. Thank you. Okay. Tell your friends. Happy Easter. Bill. Happy Easter. He has risen.

0 (1h 38m 14s):
He has risen indeed. He is risen.

2 (1h 38m 19s):
Thank you

0 (1h 38m 20s):
For having me. Oh, it's pleasure. We wanted to do it for a while. Yeah. And I know you wanted to do this before real time. Yes. But now that we did this, you could do real. I would love to. Yeah. I wanted to get to know you. Yeah. Yeah. I think it was better this way. Absolutely. First and no. I watch her show almost every week.
