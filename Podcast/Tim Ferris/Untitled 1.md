> His mindset is rooted in playing the long game and maximizing value beyond mere financial investment. He approached investing strategically, treating it as a form of asset allocation where he invested not just his money but also his attention. Starting with modest investments of around $10,000, he recognized that the return on investment (ROI) might not immediately justify the time and effort he was putting in. However, his primary goal was to become an invaluable asset on the cap table by contributing significant effort, building strong relationships, and earning referrals.

> By heavily investing his attention, he aimed to be the most helpful and valuable person involved, understanding that this would yield returns in the form of endorsements, referrals, and a loyal network of supporters. This approach also served as social signaling of his invisible capital—his knowledge, experience, and network. By focusing on being more than just a financial backer, he eventually secured advisory roles and sweat equity, marking the beginning of his successful angel investing journey. His strategy was not just about financial returns; it was about leveraging time, effort, and relationships to create long-term value, yielding both equity gains and the intangible benefits of influence and reputation.

> I had some savings and decided to make very small investments, typically around $10,000. Early on, I was focused on playing the long game. My goal was to be the most valuable, yet cheapest, labor on the cap table. I would invest $10,000 and then put in an immense amount of effort to be helpful, knowing that the ROI probably wouldn't justify the time I was putting in. The purpose of this approach was to create raving fans and get referrals. For the first six months, I wrote small checks and invested a lot of time, which eventually led to referrals and advising opportunities, allowing me to earn sweat equity. This marked the beginning of my angel investing journey. It's important to clarify that when I say I invested, in many cases, I was investing my time rather than money, as I didn’t have the funds to make larger investments. Some of the companies I got involved with early include Uber, when they had only two employees, and Shopify, where I was the first advisor when they had just 8-12 employees. I also invested in Duolingo, and participated in early secondary investments in Facebook and Twitter.

> **Invest in What You Know and Use**: Focus on products that solve personal problems, are well-understood, and can be confidently recommended to others. This approach ensures a deeper connection with the investment and increases the likelihood of identifying successful ventures. 
> 
> **Embrace Learning and Relationships**: View angel investing as a "real-world MBA", where even potential financial losses are offset by the valuable skills, knowledge, and relationships gained, which contribute to long-term success.

> My investment strategy was simple and remains unchanged: I focused on products that solved personal problems, something I understood and could be a power user of, and that I felt confident recommending to my audience. While there were some misses, the strategy has worked well overall. Angel investing is a power law game, where a few big successes can make up for the losses.

> I also viewed angel investing as a "real-world MBA," expecting to lose the money I invested but believing the skills, knowledge, and relationships I gained would more than make up for it in the long run.

> [!summary] Find Good People
> People matter because you'll be spending a significant amount of time with them, both in terms of your attention and your investment. It's essential to find individuals who are honest, willing to share, and align with your values, as these relationships are likely to lead to even greater opportunities down the line.

> One key lesson I learned is the importance of working with people you enjoy. Startups often take longer than expected to succeed, so it’s crucial to work with people who pass the "beer test" — those you’d want to spend time with socially. Good relationships often lead to future opportunities. For example, advising Uber was a great decision, but it stemmed from an earlier, less successful collaboration with Garrett on StumbleUpon.

> [!summary] 3 Steps Before Outcome
> Reflect on the three steps you took leading up to this outcome and consider if you would have approached them differently.

> Rather than focusing on the well-known decisions that led to success, I always look at what happened beforehand — those critical moments that made the big outcomes possible. Increasing your chances of success often involves being open to opportunities that may seem minor or uncertain. For me, moving to the Bay Area, and eventually San Francisco, was key to maximizing serendipity. Being in the right location made it easy to meet people and seize unexpected opportunities. In an increasingly virtual world, being able to operate in person can be a significant competitive advantage, especially if you're still in the growth phase of your career.

>I agree with the importance of location, similar to how Danny Meyer moved to Europe to work in any job he could find when he wanted to become a great restaurateur. In my experience, one of the most obvious patterns among successful people is their willingness to position themselves where opportunities are most likely to arise.
