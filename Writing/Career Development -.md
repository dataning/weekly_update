Growth Path

Scalable vs Compounded

In the solutions business, we often praise scalability — but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Scalability means our solution can grow from one user base to many or handle an expanding set of portfolios without breaking a sweat. But real success isn’t just about size; it’s about impact. That’s where compounding comes in. Instead of asking “How big can this get?” we ask “Where will each additional investment create exponential value?” In practice, we shift our focus from sheer volume to areas where benefits reinforce themselves over time — so we’re not just growing, we’re multiplying value at every step.

The same dynamic applies to our career development and professional relationships. We can cast a wide net — making a hundred casual connections in hopes of broad opportunities — or we can choose a handful of key relationships and nurture them deeply. The former feels easier — we can blindly send out Linkedin invites — but the latter delivers exponential returns in mentorship, insight, and influence.

High achievers don’t chase superficial contacts; when we receive a meeting invite, we ask, “What value will we both gain?” If a meeting keeps getting moved ten times, it’s a red flag: one side isn’t convinced it’s worth their time. To change that, we must clearly articulate our intentions — and consistently demonstrate the unique perspectives, actionable insights, or potential value we bring. By focusing on compounding our relationships, each interaction becomes a catalyst for sustained career growth.

Illusion of Career Highway

How many ex-professional footballers do we see to have become professional football managers? How many of them are actually in the Premier League or other top football leagues across Europe? Only a handful of them out of thousands. If they're used to be a high performing footballer, why wouldn't qualify them as good football managers? 




Most people pursue their careers in a similar way: they start by choosing a subject they enjoy or one they believe will make them employable. They study hard and use their degree to signal the market for a job — ideally a high‑paying one like finance. Once they land such a position, they invest 10% of their income in an index fund and earn professional certificates, take courses, or attend bootcamps to bolster their credentials. Then they move on to a new role — analyst, associate, VP, director, MD — working hard to climb the corporate ladder. If we compress the time it takes to climb that ladder, we feel we’re on a career high; the faster we achieve it, the more we feel we’ve “made it.”

It’s no surprise that most of us end up on the same pathway—whether we’re on a motorway (“M”) or an A‑road (“A”) in the UK. No matter how fast or slow we go, the real question remains: how do we want to grow our careers? Do we chase speed or longevity? That’s the biggest illusion of the career highway many people miss.

I’ve interviewed dozens of high achievers, and one common regret is moving too quickly. It might sound strange — after all, doesn’t faster promotion sound better? But promotion often comes because we’ve done one or two things right, not often our craftsmanship has reached to the master level. Imagine we want to hone our technical skills, but we’ve moved into a role that demands a completely different set of abilities. A head of solutions teams needs both deep technical expertise and strong skills in managing technologists and collaborating with stakeholders to drive growth. That’s a different ball game from writing Python, JavaScript, or Rust code — or constructing and optimizing 10 portfolios. It doesn’t mean we can’t continue refining our craft in our new role, but we’re evaluated on entirely new criteria, and the challenges of pure craftsmanship become secondary. In effect, by leaping into a role with new skill demands, we close off a large part of our previous career path. This is where we need to think about what sort of we signal we actually want to send. Yes, it would be amazing to annouce in Linkedin that we have reached to the next level. But we might just end up becoming more unemployable in the market because the cost of hiring us is becoming more expensive and why they should hire more senior individuals instead of hiring someone more junior to grow them? Senior doesn't really correlate craftsmanship and expertise and if people find out a senior is weak at both, they would soon become unemployable. Also it's harder to move to a new area - a MD in solution would feel harder to learn basic job of analyst in trading. 

This goes back to the question of what do you really want in your career? Well, isn't that everything we want. But the problem is that we don't always get everything and this is why we need to pritoise and think 


I feel my throat heating up constantly and it feels very comfortable and this makes my swollaing difficult. I tried drinking plenty of water but it doesn't seem to improve.
