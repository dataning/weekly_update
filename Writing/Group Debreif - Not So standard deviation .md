# Rolling-down deliverable

I don't know if you've noticed, but HR has implemented a rolling-down manager objective functionality in Workday. HR has highly encouraged all people managers and team managers to use this functionality. What does it mean? It means that, besides what employees agree to do with their line manager and you write up your own objectives, your manager can also push rolling objectives or deliverables from themselves, their team lead or global lead.

In a way, the company acknowledges that leaders sometimes face challenges in implementing their vision and achieving their deliverables, even if they explicitly tell their team what needs to be done. Now, leaders can roll down their objectives and deliverables to their teams. For example, Michael can roll one of his expectations down to Adam, Adam can roll his expectation down to Jisun, and Jisun can do the same to Sumer, Ishan, Abjiith, and everyone under her. Similarly, Sumer can roll down his expectations to me, Monish, and Inz, ensuring that we work on tasks that align with his deliverables. Likewise, I can roll down mine to all of you.

By doing so, everyone in the reporting line takes accountability for deliverables that should align with their line manager, EMEA lead, global lead, and business lead. We all get assessed not only on the objectives and deliverables we set for ourselves but also on the objectives and deliverables our managers and leads have rolled down.

When I learned about this functionality, I felt it was somewhat similar to what I initially did with you all using my individual GAO letter, so I was tempted to use it. However, I chose not to because I still prefer an honorable and open approach where we agree on what to work on. But there's a counter-argument for not using it sooner: if you see deliverables getting rolled down to you, you know these are high-impact tasks that your leaders prioritize, and you would think twice before not delivering them. If you decide not to deliver it, your performance could get significantly marked down, and you could end up on the evaluation list.

Currently, if you look at Workday, you don't see the roll-down objectives and deliverables, but anyone from my upstream can activate this rolling-down feature. By the way, this is not just for PAG/AFE; it's for the whole firm. Before concluding that this is a negative change, consider it from a senior manager's perspective: if the team doesn't follow the chain of command, it undermines the business and their position in the firm. This functionality is a good way of aligning priorities and deliverables from top to bottom.

Now, you might ask, what about your 'preferred' priorities and deliverables? In theory, there should not be a conflict between the roll-down objectives/deliverables and those you agree upon with your line manager. If there is a conflict, we should prioritize the roll-down objectives/deliverables because that's a direct request from the chain of command. Again, nobody is asking you to do anything life-threatening, but there is a job to be done in the business. They have been taking note of who is trying to undermine the business through their behavior and that's why you have seen the layoff. 

In my career, this is nothing new because it's the same in every job I have done. In university, if you are doing your research different from the rest of the lab, your contract is unlikely to get renewed next year. Also, if you are asked to teach first-year students (which most academics don't like because the experience is very tedious), you would not get your university contract renewed if you decide against teaching first-year students. Because you're not helping the business if you only enjoy doing your own research. One way you might get away with it is if your research impact is so significant that the business has to accommodate your interests. But the superstar who really gets everything is the one who fulfills the roll-down deliverables and make huge impact in their own work. And the one who often gets fired is the one who doesn't want to fulfil the roll-down deliverables and struggle to convince everyone that their work is high impact. 

Again, if any of you receive rolled-down objectives and deliverables from your manager, team lead, global lead, or PAG lead, you really need to think twice before failing to deliver on them.

# Using applying a new job to think about your current job


When most people apply for a new job, they often focus on what they want to do. They screen job descriptions and ask questions during interviews to ensure alignment with their preferences. However, from my experience both outside and inside BLK, you can still end up doing something you don't like. There's no guarantee of the outcome when rolling the dice in the open job market.

#### Why is this the case?

1. **Business Needs vs. Personal Preferences:** The essence of hiring or employment is to fill a role that the business deems valuable. If they need someone to clean up the SQL database, you're hired to do it. But if you get hired and then say you cannot do what you're hired for, that's going to be a nasty problem. 
    
2. **Broad Utilization of Skills:** You might think you can avoid this by asking the right questions. However, we often get hired for our skillset and experience, which can be applied to many aspects of the business ("one rock, multiple birds"). The "many aspects of the business" you are hired for could turn out to be the real job you're expected to do, meaning you might still end up doing something beyond your initial understanding.

Every year, I ask myself the same question: If I were applying for my current job in PAG, what would I ask myself first?

- **Do I get to do what I want to do?** This is a very slippery road if it's your first question. As I mentioned, you could end up debating with the business about what you want versus what they want. The worst-case scenario is continuous conflict, leading the business to realize they have the wrong person for the job — someone who only wants to do what they prefer. Meanwhile, the business is paying the salary, pension, and benefits for this person.
	- It doesn't make sense for the business to keep such an employee because the business is not an entity to fund what we want to do; it's an entity to fund what we can add value to the business. This is something I argued in one of my academic research on corporate ethical behaviors that all businesses are set up to pursue profit first, and then they can think about everything else - fairness and justice. If the business is not there anymore, what's the point of having ethical considerations? This is especially true for a stock-listed company, where the focus is even more on business growth and deliverables.

1. **How can I add value to the business while also helping myself?** This approach focuses on aligning your goals with the business's needs, ensuring you contribute value while achieving some of your personal objectives. I am building an empire and you need to help me
    

Ultimately, it's about doing what the business thinks is valuable, not just what we think is valuable.

# Doing What You Don't Want to Do

Is it helping the business?

If yes but you choose not to be the one to add this value to the business, the next question is why?
- Find a way to enjoy the unenjoyable - To me, that's the way of life. If you always enjoy doing what you enjoy, I think that's lucky and make sure you can always have that luck in your life. 
- If the argument is you have something more impactful to do, that's great. But people need to agree that what you're doing is more important than what they're asking you to do immediately.
- If the argument is you don't enjoy doing something, you really need to have a good justification. People can interpret this in many ways:
	- You might be seen as undermining the business by putting your personal feelings first. This can imply that you are not as valuable as your peers who are willing to do the task. If this task or area is extremely important to the team or business, refusing to do it can signal a lack of commitment. 
	- Unless your manager says otherwise, the person who steps in for the business will be considered before you for higher impact opportunities and promotion.
	- If you choose to do something else compared to what you're asked to do, you’d better succeed in making a large impact. If the impact is minimal, it suggests that you are prioritizing your own preferences over the business needs.

It's crucial to balance personal preferences with business needs. Doing tasks you may not enjoy but are valuable to the business demonstrates commitment and flexibility. If you consistently avoid such tasks without strong justification, it can harm your reputation and limit your opportunities for advancement.

Jisun, Sumer and I have had many intensive discussion on how we can do better as a team for the business - AFE and MASS, and how we can manage our people better as managers. One thing came out is that we might need a change in some ways to support AFE, PAG, AAA, EMEA AAA, MASS, people (this includes both direct reports and their managers). We don't know what change can be made to make everyone better off at the same time but we all agree that a change is needed.
