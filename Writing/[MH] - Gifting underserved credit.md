Pygmalion effect

Giving someone underserved credit to boost their performance plays on their desire to align their image with the perception others have of them. However, if the individuals are honest, they will tell the truth when asked. If they continue to perform at the same level, they are likely to either leave or be dismissed. 

> The psychological effect you're describing is known as the "Pygmalion effect," or more commonly, the power of positive expectations. This concept originates from a phenomenon observed in educational and organizational psychology where higher expectations from leaders or teachers lead to better performance from students or team members. Essentially, when you show someone that you believe in their capabilities, they are likely to perform better in order to meet those expectations. 
	This effect is somewhat similar to offering a free trial period to consumers before they commit to a full product or service. Both strategies rely on engagement and positive experiences to encourage a desired outcome—improved performance in the case of the Pygmalion effect, and a purchase decision in the case of a free trial. However, the underlying mechanisms and intentions differ:
> 1. **Pygmalion Effect**: This is about influencing behavior through expectations. When you give credit or positive feedback to someone who hasn't been performing well, you are essentially setting a higher expectation, which can motivate them to improve their performance. It's a psychological strategy to enhance self-efficacy and commitment.
> 2. **Free Trial Period**: This is a marketing strategy designed to reduce the risk or hesitation associated with purchasing a new product or service. By allowing potential customers to experience the offering without financial commitment, companies hope to build trust and demonstrate value, thereby increasing the likelihood of a purchase.
    While both methods aim to stimulate a positive action (improved performance or purchasing), the Pygmalion effect focuses on interpersonal relationships and perceptions, whereas free trials are about product experience and consumer confidence.
