At the beginning of the year, I implicitly discussed the idea of a "pod PM" within the context of our solution business. The concept is that all of us serve as "pod PMs" to our leaders, with the goal of maximising the "solution alpha" within the given project (considering client mandates and solution constraints).

I spent the past two weeks talking to our project partners, and they greatly appreciate the idea of "solution alpha" because it aligns with what they want to see in our deliverables (although they admit they don't often share this feedback explicitly). Again, it's part of our job to maximise the "solution alpha" for our business sponsors as well as solution leaders, which will largely determine our performance as a team and as individuals. The larger the "solution alpha" we can generate, the better the performance we create for the team and ourselves.

Unlike the alpha we often discuss in terms of investment returns, "solution alpha" can be hard to quantify and is not always clear to a "pod PM" in the solution business. I would like to take some time to break it down as I see it, and I hope that you might pick up a thing or two to improve the way you perform in your area.

Business sponsors want their return just like those who come to BlackRock for asset management services. They don't want a return just marginally matching the S&P 500 or a bank-savings-like return. Otherwise, why should they bother going through the pain of talking to us, scoping with us, and negotiating with us? Most of them, if not all of them, want a return higher than the benchmark.

What does this mean in the "solution alpha" sense? As "pod PMs" in the solution business, we need to think about whether our solution delivery is at a matching-the-benchmark-return level or a beating-the-benchmark-return level. We might think if we just fulfil the requests business sponsors have raised, we're definitely at a beating-the-benchmark-return level.

However, beating-the-benchmark-return level must be cross-validated. This means that we cannot just assume we have beaten the benchmark by simply ticking all the given boxes; there might be boxes not yet uncovered that need to be fulfilled by those who show strong emotional ownership. I understand this is a bit counterintuitive, but this is where business sponsors tend to distinguish the exceptional of us from the mediocre of us. For the individuals of us, that's how we signal we're ready to embark on the next level.

Let me break this down further. I call this the 'iceberg of needs' — there are needs that can be seen, such as those raised by business sponsors and those we can see. But then there are those needs under the water, like the bottom of an iceberg, where nobody knows. It's common that we're focused on the needs business sponsors raise and the needs we feel, but the tricky part is how to address the needs nobody knows but are still critical to the business. You can see this is where the biggest "solution alpha" hides and often what separates those who kick the can from the greatest — it's the ability to think through the perspective of business sponsors and tease out if they might actually need more things than they realize and help them prepare better.

Now, you might raise the counterargument: why on earth would we want to do this when it's almost guaranteed to give us more work and headaches? Don't we want less work or to finish the project faster, especially if we don't like the project? Yes, that's a fair point. However, you need to ask yourself if you would want to see the same doctor if he or she only operated on what you tell them, because you might not know your stomach ache has nothing to do with your stomach. Maybe the doctor would need to check other parts of your body. The point is that it's the one with strong emotional ownership who might address the real need here. We're the doctors to the business patients, and we need to be mindful of whether those "solution paracetamol" can really fix the "stomach ache" of the business patients.

In addition, if you really want to develop an authentic relationship with the stakeholders, this is the door you can knock on and take the first step. Otherwise, all the business requests are just transactions, and they wouldn't see us as great partners to work with, nor would they be willing to sponsor us further. Again, would you spend time writing a good review for a supermarket staff if you just go in and check out what you need? Perhaps not, because the relationship is too transactional. But if they have done something amazing for you, wouldn't you do something for them?

Besides identifying the unmet needs of business sponsors, we also need to think about how they would like to collect the "solution alpha." Now you might think, isn't that just a handshake with both sides, given that we are the ones more or less after the "solution alpha"? No, actually business sponsors are as keen as we are on collecting the "solution alpha." Again, if they're not, why should they bother going through the pain of talking to us, scoping with us, and negotiating with us?

Like us, business sponsors declare their deliverables to their leaders and peers. Imagine they wish to share their sponsored solution with their line manager, senior leaders, and peers but cannot for whatever reasons. You can understand how the "solution alpha" for them can diminish rapidly. That's not to say it's our fault or that they shouldn't have taken more ownership. The point is that all of them have a strong interest in showing the world their shiny sponsored toy, and they want to win as much as we do. 

Business sponsors would love to commit as much as they would like, even though they might have multiple competing commitments, but they really hope us to help them 'solve' that particular problem. They cannot help with everything, but they can help if we can articulate what we need to help them. Again, this is the next level of the game — if you are able to identify those things they can do for you to cook something great, they can give them to you. But if we fail to identify the things critical to the solution development, and they would have to put more effort to support the solution development, they might not really enjoy the experience. Imagine you have to come down and fix the toilet with the plumber you hired — it sounds a great co-creation story to some extent, but you as the client might also question if it's worth all the money. Again, this is not about us doing all the work, it's about the experience they have and whether they would want to do this again with us in the future — inviting us to their next game.

Now, I can spill out many tips and advice about how to succeed in the solution business, but I think they are just garbage if none of us want to evolve our mindset. That's the one thing I feel I cannot unlock easily — coding can be taught, Aladdin can be taught, quant/CFA/investment knowledge can be taught. But I don't know how much one's mindset can change unless you are the one who decides to evolve - becoming a better professional. If you feel you have been a victim in the solution business, we can spend some time talking about it. But I can guarantee what we have seen here is not unique — I have seen worse places. The recipe for success is almost the same: In a situation of you against you, how would you respond? 

"Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares? Are you up for this? Are you? Look I just need to know because the city, i-i-it's flying. Ok, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going out there because it's my job, okay, and I can't do my job and babysit. Doesn't matter what you did or what you were, if you go out there you fight, and you fight to kill. Staying here you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door - You are an Avenger."

To get the beating the benchmark return, we need to think about the solution need beyond what they say, especially what they don't say. Now, you might question why on earth we would like to do that, esepcially if it means giving us more work. If they need it, they can raise it later. Unfortunately, if we take this mindset, business sponsors tend to feel that we don't have emotional ownership. In a way, we're proposing a transactional 



If they haven't raised it, we can just pretend it's not there. This is the part bugging me a lot 


. Otherwise, they might move 




You might question if that is true, they should have given us more or spent more time with us on thinking about the solution development. But they don't just work with us; they have multi obligation. Still, they have given their names to the solution so it's in their interest in seeing some form of 'return'.  



It might be true that sometimes they don't spend enough time with us over the solution development but it doesn't reject the idea that they're very keen on collecting the solution alpha. 


determine whether they have an interest in the solution alpha.  


They want to collect it in a way that allows them to use it for its intended purpose, understand how it works and what it can do, and, more importantly, know how to manage it. Additionally, they want to be able to share it with their leaders, colleagues, partners or clients. 



- we cannot just assume we have delivered what we think we have. For example, if we believe we have delivered a value of 10, but the stakeholder feels we have only delivered 2, there is a discrepancy. This isn't just in a quantitative sense, like promising to deliver 4 items but only providing 2, but also in a qualitative sense (we might think something is very impressive, but they perceive it as subpar). 

When there is a large misalignment between our expectations and those of the stakeholders, as your manager, I prefer that we overdeliver rather than underdeliver. It's like Five Guys – you feel happier when getting a bit more fries than you ordered. However, you also understand the disappointment people can feel although they don't spell it out often when you receive fewer fries than you ordered or if the fries are of lower quality. My take away to all of you is that make sure at least we overdeliver a bit more good fries like the Five Guys. 

Second, we need to learn how to detect and manage discrepancies earlier. This is really about the hierarchy of needs—there are needs they feel, needs you feel, and needs nobody feels. It's common that we successfully tackle the needs they feel and the needs we feel, but the tricky part is how to address the needs nobody feels or raises but it's still critical. You can see this is where the biggest "solution alpha" hides and often what separates the newbie and seasonal, the buget hotel and 5-star hotel. The alpha is not about luxury, but about whether we can think through their perspective and tease out if they might actually need more things than they realize and help them manage it.

Let's put down an example — 'solution socialization'. Normally, this feels like the business stakeholder's job because they know the context better than the solution developers. However, what if we can help facilitate or arrange the socialization for them? It's human nature to share their excitement about having a new shiny toy with their friends, colleagues, and family. Maybe we can help them facilitate an 'I have an amazing solution to share!' session with some of their friends, colleagues, or people who might benefit from this solution. Obviously, they might not want to share it with anyone because the solution is not that great, or they just don't have time to do it. Again, this gives you another way to detect if there's hidden unfilled needs. 

Third, it's always in the business sponsors to see their sponsored solution getting the love. If we couldn't give them that, it's 



This is part of the reason I seldom use the word "learning," because learning is like breathing – we are always students of the market. Unlike the alpha we often discuss in terms of investment returns, solution alpha can be hard to quantify and is not always clear to a "pod portfolio manager" in the solution business. I would like to take some time to break it down as I see it – I spent the past two weeks with MASS individuals, and they greatly appreciate the idea of "solution alpha" because it aligns with what they want to see in our deliverable (although they feel they don't often share this feedback explicitly).

First of all, solution alpha is never one-sided – we cannot just assume we have delivered what we think we have. For example, if we believe we have delivered a value of 10, but the stakeholder feels we have only delivered 2, there is a discrepancy. This isn't just in a quantitative sense, like promising to deliver 4 items but only providing 2, but also in a qualitative sense (we might think something is very impressive, but they perceive it as subpar). When there is a large misalignment between our expectations and those of the stakeholders, as your manager, I prefer that we overdeliver rather than underdeliver. It's like Five Guys – you feel happier when getting more fries than you ordered. However, you also understand the disappointment people can feel when you receive fewer fries than you ordered or if they are of lower quality. My take away to all of you is that make sure we overdeliver a bit more fries like the Five Guys. 

Second, consider how stakeholders would like to collect the solution alpha. It's easy for us in the solution business to check a box by shipping a feature, but does it mean the same box-checking for our stakeholders? Perhaps they have another four steps before they can really check off one box. In other words, what you want to check off is not just your box on your paper, but also the box in the minds of our stakeholders. Stakeholders would really appreciate it if we take the lead in the 'socialization' process. You might question how we know whom to reach out to or think we're just solution developers and it's business owner's job to promote the solution. However, you're likely to collect more solution alpha if you drive the solutions through impact, not just development. Ask your stakeholders, colleagues, and managers, "Who else can benefit from this?" Then, set up the 'Hello World' catch-up meetings and connect prospectives with our stakeholders. Again, think about how the stakeholders would want to treat their shiny new toy — perhaps they really want to tell their friends, colleagues, family, or the whole world that they have the coolest shiny toy. This not only shows us have emotional ownership, but it also allows the solution to undergo cross-validation. The more we show it to people, the more they will feel collecting the alpha in the solution. One of the biggest alphas is that there're teams beyond the original business sponsors want to leverage it. That means that the business sponsors have made 'good spillover' contribution to the wider community (so do we). 

Finally, dealing with expectation discrepancies. Before blaming business sponsors for being unfair or cunning in their business requests, think about how we can first listen, extract, and log the requests. Let's not react impulsively but respond in the most professional way. I don't believe there are "stupid requests," but I believe that anything can be negotiated and everyone could leave the negotiation table with 'something.' I know this is going to be really hard for most of you in the early career, but let's work together to find a way to move forward — even if it's just a matter of emailing someone. If you find yourself being cornered, please use your manager as a resource.




Think about how stakeholders would want to collect the solution alpha. 


That means that there's a breakdown in communication and expectation. Before blaming our clients being cunning, one thing I think we'd love all of us to ask ourselves what sort of the business we're in - transactional or relationship?
